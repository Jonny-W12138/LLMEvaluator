Therefore, the international market\\u0027s outlook on China\\u0027s economic growth has been effectively improved, and overseas investors\\u0027 confidence in the A-share market has been boosted, foreign institutions said at the SSE meeting.In its 2025 outlook, investment bank Goldman Sachs holds a strategic preference for Chinese stocks, as the A-share market is less sensitive to tariff policies in developed markets or the fluctuations of the renminbi\\u0027s exchange rate. Meanwhile, it expects relaxed liquidity in China to help buoy the Chinese stock market.Goldman Sachs experts estimated that the benchmark CSI 300 Index for the A-share market will rise 13 percent in 2025, while A-share companies\\u0027 average earnings per share will grow 10 percent. The increased buybacks made by listed companies will further drive up the A-share market\\u0027s valuation, they said.In its outlook for 2025, JP Morgan Asset Management showed more preference for A-share technology companies, especially those specializing in artificial intelligence and renewable resources.In another development, the eight foreign securities brokerages, fund companies, Qualified Foreign Institutional Investor program institutions and asset managers represented at a meeting held on Saturday by the Shenzhen Stock Exchange said the long-term investment value of Chinese high-end manufacturing, information technology and consumer electronics industries has become especially noticeable.The incremental supportive policies introduced since late September have largely stabilized market expectations and boosted international investors\\u0027 confidence, said the foreign institutions, which vowed to become more deeply rooted in the Chinese market.The Shenzhen bourse said it has made continued efforts to improve market transparency and predictability to facilitate foreign institutions\\u0027 business expansion and investment, and the exchange hopes that foreign institutions, which are already important A-share market participants, can stick to long-term investment and make joint efforts to advance the sustained and sound development of the Chinese capital market.According to data released by the State Administration of Foreign Exchange in December, inbound securities investment in China reported a net inflow of $93.1 billion in the first three quarters of 2024, marking four consecutive quarters of positive inflows.Experts at Haitong Securities said that the A-share market, as an emerging market, is likely to provide more lucrative returns in 2025, as monetary policies around the globe have become more relaxed. Therefore, the A-share market is expected to attract around 2 trillion yuan ($273 billion) in capital inflow this year, they said.Meng Lei, China equity strategist at UBS Securities, said that the valuation of the A-share market is expected to rise in 2025, driven by robust net capital inflows from individual investors, the continued entry of patient capital, and the return of international investors.",

The issuance total, according to market tracker Wind Info, was up 26 percent year-on-year, a record high.The growth was driven by growing participation of purely foreign issuers \\u2014 or overseas issuers without affiliations with Hong Kong-based institutions.Issuances by purely foreign issuers nearly tripled from about 27 billion yuan in 2023 to more than 75 billion yuan in 2024. Their proportion in total panda bond issuances rose from about 17 percent to almost 40 percent, said Deutsche Bank, a panda bond underwriter.Germany has emerged as the largest issuer region outside Hong Kong, issuing about 22 billion yuan in panda bonds this year. Panda bond issuances from corporate entities in France, Singapore and Canada also rose sharply this year.\\u0022\\u0022Panda bond issuers are expected to become more diversified (in 2025),\\u0022\\u0022 said Samuel Fischer, head of China onshore debt capital markets at Deutsche Bank.\\u0022\\u0022In addition to an increase of issuers from developed markets, new issuers from the Middle East and Latin America are expected to enter the (panda bond) market.\\u0022\\u0022Fischer attributed this trend to the growing use of the renminbi in these regions, increased cross-border economic cooperation, and the renminbi\\u0027s favorable yield advantage \\u2014 the average coupon rate of panda bonds issued this year dropped to 2.5 percent from 3.1 percent in 2023.While China cut interest rates to stabilize economic growth, interest rates have stayed elevated in the United States this year following efforts to curb inflation, sending the difference between the 10-year treasury yields of the US and China as high as 283 basis points as of Monday, said Wind Info.Ming Ming, chief economist at CITIC Securities, said that underpinning foreign issuers\\u0027 growing appetites also includes China\\u0027s regulatory changes in 2022 deepening financial opening-up, which allowed funds raised via panda bonds to be remitted abroad.Pan Gongsheng, governor of the People\\u0027s Bank of China, the country\\u0027s central bank, said at a meeting in November with foreign financial institutions that the country will expand connectivity between domestic and international markets and promote institutional opening-up of both the financial services sector as well as financial markets.The growing appeal of panda bonds reflects the rising role of the renminbi for international financing, a trend that is expected to continue into 2025, Fischer said, as China maintains an accommodative monetary policy while foreign enterprises continue to increase investments in China, driving renminbi financing needs.\\u0022\\u0022The renminbi financing environment remains competitive and appealing,\\u0022\\u0022 he said, adding that Deutsche Bank itself has used up an 8-billion-yuan panda bond issuance quota in June, with plans to apply for more, \\u0022\\u0022subject to regulatory approval and favorable market conditions\\u0022\\u0022.The panda bond market is also expected to see both larger sizes and longer maturities of issuances, Fischer said, further strengthening the panda markets\\u0027 global status as a key option for issuers.Thanks to improved liquidity conditions, the panda bond market has seen several issuances at a size of about 5 billion yuan this year, he added, which represents a significant increase from previous years and is comparable to issuances in the Europe and US markets.",

        "full-text": "BEIJING -- Just as a single decisive move can energize a chess game, China\\u0027s latest initiative to address local government debt risks marks a crucial step in revitalizing the growth prospects of the world\\u0027s second-largest economy.The move comes as China gears up to navigate economic headwinds both at home and abroad, with a supportive fiscal policy serving as a crucial pillar to sustain a steady and robust recovery.Local governments, the linchpins of the country\\u0027s fiscal outlays, were stuck in a dilemma of high debts and falling revenues, bringing challenges to the efforts of bolstering the economy. With the debt-relief package, a well-timed financial adjustment to ease local governments\\u0027 financing strains, the country is better positioned to pursue the broader agenda of fostering economic stability and progress.CRITICAL MOVEUnveiled in November, the debt-relief package is \\u0022\\u0022the most significant measure introduced in recent years\\u0022\\u0022 to tackle the challenges, according to Finance Minister Lan Fo\\u0027an.It includes raising the debt ceiling of local governments by 6 trillion yuan ($834.36 billion) over the next three years to replace the existing \\u0022\\u0022hidden debts,\\u0022\\u0022 a form of off-budget borrowings through local government financing platforms, government investment funds, and other channels.As of Wednesday, 29 provincial-level regions, including Beijing, Jiangsu and Guizhou, had issued or disclosed plans for refinancing bonds, meeting this year\\u0027s issuance target of 2 trillion yuan.Additionally, local governments are allowed to use 800 billion yuan annually in special-purpose bond issuance for the five consecutive years starting from 2024, aimed at providing debt relief to replace \\u0022\\u0022hidden debts.\\u0022\\u0022Officials estimate that swapping the off-budget debts for on-budget is expected to save 600 billion yuan in interest for local governments over five years.The Ministry of Finance has confirmed that at the end of 2023, the \\u0022\\u0022hidden debts\\u0022\\u0022 stood at 14.3 trillion yuan, which authorities aim to address by the end of 2028.Under the new arrangements, some 2 trillion yuan of \\u0022\\u0022hidden debts\\u0022\\u0022 accumulated from housing improvement projects in run-down areas due by 2029 and beyond will also be paid in accordance with the original contracts.Analysts believe the debt swap program will unclog capital flow to the real economy and help sustain the momentum of the economic recovery.With the debt-relief package, the total hidden debts that local governments need to address by the end of 2028 will be cut from 14.3 trillion yuan to 2.3 trillion yuan. This can free up financial resources and policy space for local governments to promote development, improve people\\u0027s well-being, boost investment and consumption, and support technological innovation, according to Lan.CHANGING APPROACHBesides its unprecedented scale, the package reflects a fundamental shift in China\\u0027s approach to resolving local government debt risks, according to analysts.Unlike the country\\u0027s earlier efforts to resolve debt risks, the latest initiative reflects a shift from reactive crisis management to proactive and systemic resolution, and a transition from dual-track oversight of explicit and implicit debts to transparent and standardized management of all debts, said Fan Ruoying, a researcher at Bank of China.It also indicates the central authority\\u0027s guiding thoughts of defusing debt risks through development while trading time for development space, and illustrates the government\\u0027s determination to promote economic growth while mitigating local government debt risks, said Luo Zhiheng, chief economist at Yuekai Securities.Under the new arrangements, local governments still bear the debt repayment responsibility, but swapping to on-budget debts, with longer repayment periods and lower interests, can help ease the pressure on them to repay short-term debts. Effective debt swaps allow local governments to have more funds and space to promote economic growth and ensure people\\u0027s livelihoods.Lan said the finance ministry, together with relevant departments, will maintain a \\u0022\\u0022zero tolerance\\u0022\\u0022 stance on increases of new hidden debts, further improve the local government debt management, and accelerate the establishment of a debt system with Chinese characteristics in line with the country\\u0027s high-quality development.The third plenary session of the 20th Communist Party of China Central Committee, held in July, made arrangements concerning the issue, which include improving the government debt management system, establishing a system for monitoring and regulating all local government debt as well as long-term mechanisms for preventing and defusing hidden debt risks, and moving faster to reform and transform local government financing platforms.STRONGER POLICY SUPPORTThe expedited implementation of the debt-relief package indicates that China is enhancing the intensity of its proactive fiscal policy, and the country still has a relatively large space for fiscal policy maneuvering, with its government debt level far lower than that of other major economies, according to officials and economists.By the end of 2023, the average government debt-to-GDP ratio for G20 countries was 118.2 percent, while the average debt-to-GDP ratio for G7 countries stood at 123.4 percent, according to data from the International Monetary Fund.In contrast, China\\u0027s total government debt was 85 trillion yuan by the end of 2023, resulting in a government debt ratio of 67.5 percent.The country has set its deficit-to-GDP ratio at 3 percent for 2024, which means 4.06 trillion yuan in government deficit, an increase of 180 billion yuan over the 2023 budget figure, according to this year\\u0027s government work report.China has vowed to implement a more proactive fiscal policy in 2025, set a higher deficit-to-GDP ratio and ensure that its fiscal policy is continuously forceful and more impactful, according to last week\\u0027s tone-setting meeting, the Central Economic Work Conference.Next year, China will actively use the room for a higher deficit, increase the issuance of local government special-purpose bonds, continue to issue ultra-long special treasury bonds, and increase transfer payments from the central government to local governments, said Lan last month.",
        "ft_llama_summary": "China has raised the debt ceiling of local governments by 6 trillion yuan ($834 billion) over the next three years to replace the existing \"hidden debts\", a form of off-budget borrowings. The move is aimed at easing local governments' financing strains and providing debt relief. The debt swap programme will help sustain the momentum of the economic recovery, analysts said.",
        "manual_gpt_summary": "In November, China unveiled a debt-relief package to address local government debt risks, raising the debt ceiling by 6 trillion yuan and enabling bond refinancing to replace hidden debts by 2028. This proactive approach aims to reduce debt pressure, save 600 billion yuan in interest, and promote economic growth through enhanced fiscal policy, investment, and innovation."

Demand deposit rates for financial infrastructure institutions should be reasonably set with reference to the excess reserve rate, currently at 0.35 percent, while those for other nonbanking financial institutions should refer to the seven-day reverse repo rate, a main policy interest rate benchmark currently at 1.5 percent, the initiative said.The initiative is aimed at addressing the weak link in interest rate policy transmission that nonbank financial institution deposit rates hardly follow changes in the central bank\\u0027s policy rates, creating arbitrage opportunities.From the second half of 2022 to the third quarter of this year, the seven-day reverse repo rate dropped from 2.2 percent to 1.5 percent. However, the rate for demand deposits among nonbank financial institutions remained largely unchanged at around 1.75 percent, according to authoritative sources, while the general demand deposit rate at China\\u0027s four biggest banks was only around 0.1 percent.The two initiatives were passed on Thursday at a meeting of the self-disciplinary mechanism, the People\\u0027s Bank of China, the country\\u0027s central bank, said in a statement on Friday.The central bank statement said the meeting stressed that financial institutions should effectively implement the two initiatives, communicate and explain them clearly to clients and pass on the effects of stabilized funding costs to the lending side, thereby increasing support for the real economy.",

The measures align with national directives issued in October, which aim to address societal concerns and create a conducive environment for more young people to consider parenthood.To provide inclusive and diverse child care services, the document also encourages industrial parks and employers to offer child care services for children under 3 years old at rates below market prices.Shanghai has set a target for 85 percent of kindergartens, including government-run ones, to offer child care services for children under 3 by the end of 2025. The city also plans to further develop affordable child care services, enhance the quality of baobaowu \\u2014 government-run playgrounds for toddlers in each subdistrict \\u2014 and expand free caregiving services for families in need. Additionally, colleges and vocational schools will be encouraged to establish child care-related programs to nurture professional talent in the field.Surveys conducted across China have identified the lack of child care support and challenges in accessing child care facilities for children under 3 as significant factors deterring young people from starting families. Economic pressures and the demands of child-rearing are also contributing to the issue.China\\u0027s fertility rate has been declining in recent years, dropping from 1.58 births per woman in 2017 to approximately 1 per woman in 2023. The year 2023 also marked the second consecutive year the country recorded negative population growth.Shanghai has seen a sharp decline in births among its permanent residents, with 98,000 births recorded in 2023, compared to 218,400 in 2016.To address these trends, the Shanghai document proposes implementing differentiated housing policies for families with two or more children and fostering fertility-friendly employment models. Eligible families with more than one child will be prioritized in the city\\u0027s housing support system, allowing them to move up in the queue and choose larger apartments when applying for affordable housing.Another focus is on addressing the accommodation needs of young adults and increasing the supply of affordable rental homes.In December, Shanghai introduced a policy encouraging employers to create \\u0022\\u0022parent-friendly job posts\\u0022\\u0022 with flexible working hours and arrangements to help employees balance work and family responsibilities. Sectors such as manufacturing, hospitality, food services, housekeeping and emerging industries in the digital, cultural and creative sectors are receiving support to pilot these initiatives.Some parents believe more accessible child-related services in education and healthcare could alleviate people\\u0027s fears about having children.Zhao Jing, a 35-year-old mother of a 5-year-old girl in Shanghai\\u0027s Changning district, noted that by the end of 2023, pediatric departments had opened in all 10 subdistrict community health service centers in the district.

        "full-text": "Throughout history, groups of people such as soldiers and expedition crews braving the great outdoors have been fueled by the food they ate. More recently, the same can be said of polar exploration teams.During his tenure with China\\u0027s 15th Antarctic expedition from 1998 to 1999, chef Xia Rongjun demonstrated extraordinary culinary skills under limited conditions, helping to improve the health of the crew as they worked in the icy region. The chef\\u0027s innovative approach has been influential in subsequent polar expeditions.Enticing outsidersDue to the strong winds in Antarctica, the aroma of the hot meals prepared at Zhongshan Station could still be smelled as far as 100 kilometers away at Australia\\u0027s Davis Station. Sometimes, these foreign crews couldn\\u0027t resist the temptation and visited Zhongshan Station for a meal, according to Xia.\\u0022\\u0022The Russians and Australians there mainly have Western food such as bread, pastries and fruits, but no Chinese cuisine,\\u0022\\u0022 he said.Interestingly, the pleasant smells wafting from the station not only attracted people, but also penguins, seals, skuas and petrels, the chef said.Xia used braised beef as an example.\\u0022\\u0022After braising a portion of premium Australian beef we purchased, it exuded a flavor that Australians themselves struggled to reproduce,\\u0022\\u0022 he explained. \\u0022\\u0022On one occasion, a member of the Australian team even spent $500 on beef and requested that I braise it for him, leaving me feeling flattered.\\u0022\\u0022Xia brought a great variety of delicious Chinese food to Antarctica during his stay, creating a smorgasbord that included over 40 dishes involving braised meats, noodles, soups, desserts, pastries and fruits. The chef said he carefully selected the dishes being served, taking the health of his diners into consideration.\\u0022\\u0022I worked with a doctor, using data from our team members\\u0027 monthly checkups to craft a nutritious menu,\\u0022\\u0022 he said proudly. \\u0022\\u0022The extensive menu spanned nearly a hundred pages and was preserved as a resource for future team members.\\u0022\\u0022Cured by cuisineDuring the polar night, an 80-day period during which there was no sunlight, workers developed pale complexions and struggled with a lack of calcium, leading to dental issues, weak bones and overall weakness and fatigue.The inadequate light made outdoor work hazardous, so most individuals remained inside the station until the polar night concluded. The solitude and quietness of the polar region created a melancholy atmosphere, creating mental health problems among some members of the group. The harsh environment placed significant psychological strain on the workers.Xia admitted that he was also affected by the polar night blues and tried to find ways to cope.He initially spent a lot of time honing his cooking skills, but he soon discovered that the team had developed little enthusiasm for his food and ate sparingly. To get them interested, he proposed a collaborative idea where people from various Chinese regions could join him in the kitchen and prepare some of their local dishes and snacks.It turned out to be the spark the team needed.\\u0022\\u0022Amazingly, people bounced back through their cooking and tasting of hometown dishes that they had missed for months,\\u0022\\u0022 Xia said.Due to the contributions of the team members hailing from places such as Beijing, Shanghai, Qingdao in Shandong province, Dalian in Liaoning province and Xiamen in Fujian province, the team was able to enjoy a range of new dishes. These included Beijing-style hot pot, Xiamen snacks and Shanghai specialties.\\u0022\\u0022Each dish exuded a truly authentic flavor that delighted our taste buds,\\u0022\\u0022 the chef said.He added that later, they voted to decide which region\\u0027s dishes were the best, and the popular ones were kept on the menu.\\u0022\\u0022This approach successfully motivated everyone, and was at the forefront of the fond memories we had of passing those polar nights,\\u0022\\u0022 Xia recalled. \\u0022\\u0022Years later, when we reunited, we talked about the food and how much we missed the taste of those dishes.\\u0022\\u0022In great shapeAfter a year at Zhongshan Station, the supply of vegetables and fruits was running low. Liu Shuyan, the station leader of the 16th expedition, brought new supplies with him to the station.When Liu arrived, he gave each member a hug and a punch on the chest, saying, \\u0022\\u0022Your team\\u0027s mental outlook is the best I\\u0027ve ever seen,\\u0022\\u0022 according to Xia.\\u0022\\u0022Our mental state was indeed excellent. Each member underwent strict physical examinations before departure and another upon return, and the comparison showed that we had maintained very good health,\\u0022\\u0022 the chef said.\\u0022\\u0022What\\u0027s noteworthy is that the results after the return showed that our physical condition was the best among all 15 expeditions, according to the State Oceanic Administration and Polar Research Institute of China,\\u0022\\u0022 he added.Xia was responsible for cooking for 200 people each day.In general, he prepared meals three times a day, but increased it to five times daily during the polar day period. During that time, the team took advantage of the constant sunlight and warmer weather, sometimes working over 18 hours a day.As a result, Xia said he also had to work longer hours. To maximize his availability, he placed a camp bed next to the kitchen storeroom with two quilts, so he would be ready to get up and continue working at any time, he said.",

This marks a milestone in the country\\u0027s marine engineering equipment manufacturing industry.The record-breaking vessel \\u0022\\u0022Erhang Changqing\\u0022\\u0022 features the world\\u0027s highest derrick at the stern, with the largest piling capacity and strongest resistance to wind and waves, its developer the Second Harbor Engineering Co, Ltd under China Communications Construction Co, Ltd told Xinhua on Monday.The vessel, built by the Shanghai Zhenhua Heavy Industries Co Ltd, measures 130.5 meters in length, 40.8 meters in width, and 8.4 meters in depth. It is equipped with a 150-meter-high derrick, capable of handling massive pile foundations weighing up to 700 tonnes with a diameter of seven meters.The former record holder, \\u0022\\u0022Yihang Jinzhuang,\\u0022\\u0022 also built by the ZPMC, was delivered to CCCC First Harbor Engineering Co Ltd in 2022 with a slightly shorter derrick, 142 meters.China leads the production of large offshore wind turbines worldwide, making these giant vessels essential for foundation and turbine installations.In the construction of large bridges and offshore wind farms, multiple steel pipes must be driven into the seabed to form a pile foundation, a task performed by pile-driving vessels.A pile-driving vessel consists of three main components \\u2014 the hull, derrick and oil cylinder. The hull serves as the platform, the derrick provides support, and the cylinder acts as the vessel\\u0027s \\u0022\\u0022heart\\u0022\\u0022 to power the moves of the pile frame.A technological breakthrough made by the CCCC Second Harbor Engineering Co, Ltd is the critical component of an oil cylinder. The one on the new vessel is fully self-developed and weighs 385 tonnes, with a nearly two-meter diameter and a world record-breaking length of 28 meters.The oil cylinder is the heaviest and tallest in the world, standing as tall as a 10-story building.Historically, the manufacturing of large oil cylinders in China faces challenges as their components, such as sealing rings, bearing lubrication pads and corrosion-resistant materials, are mainly imported with complicated procurement and high costs, said Yang Xiuli, deputy chief engineer of the CCCC Second Harbor Engineering Co Ltd.In collaboration with six leading related domestic enterprises and four universities including the prestigious Tsinghua University and Tongji University, \\u0022\\u0022we have successively developed domestic sealing rings, bearing lubrication pads, and corrosion-resistant materials, achieving the goal of localizing super-large and super-long oil cylinders,\\u0022\\u0022 said Yang.In addition, the vessel\\u0027s advanced position system ensures incredible precision, placing piles within just a few centimeters of their designated location on the seabed.The \\u0022\\u0022Erhang Changqing\\u0022\\u0022 is designed to be more environmentally friendly and intelligent than traditional piling vessels.It utilizes supercapacitors and energy storage batteries to smooth power fluctuations in the grid, paired with a high-efficiency permanent magnet motor for hoisting, resulting in lower fuel consumption and significantly reduced carbon emissions.Before piling operations, the computer automatically calculates the positioning precision of the piles, while during the piling operation, it will conduct real-time safety monitoring, automatically detect operational processes and generate construction reports, said Yang.",

It marks the first time that a high-quality genome at the chromosomal level and annotation information has been obtained for the species, a type of carp, and represents a significant advancement to restore the fish population, China Science Daily reported on Dec 26.The achievement was made by a research team led by Professor Lu Jianguo from the School of Marine Sciences at Sun Yat-sen University and researchers from the agricultural science institute of Jiujiang, Jiangxi province. The research findings were published on Dec 19 in Scientific Data, a scientific journal under Nature.The Ochetobius elongatus, once an important freshwater economic fish in China and widely distributed in the Yangtze River Basin, has experienced a sharp decline in population over the past three decades due to environmental degradation and human activities, said Liang Xuanguang, co-first author of the research article.The fish has a small and slender body, with a maximum length of 55 centimeters and a weight of 500 to 1,000 grams. As a migratory fish, it reproduces from April to June each year. After hatching, the young fish leave the rivers and migrate to lakes for feeding and overwintering. It takes three to five years for them to reach sexual maturity.The species was listed as \\u0022\\u0022critically endangered\\u0022\\u0022 on China\\u0027s Red List of Biodiversity in 2023, Liang said.Following the implementation of the 10-year fishing ban in the Yangtze River at the beginning of 2020, an improvement has been seen in the fish stocks of the river.In December 2020, seven Ochetobius elongatus fish were discovered in the Gongan section of the Yangtze River, the first instance of multiple individuals being recorded in recent years, said Liang.The reappearance of the rare fish provides an opportunity for conservation efforts.Despite the application of conservation genetics and genomics in the protection of several endangered species within the Yangtze River Basin \\u2014 such as the Yangtze finless porpoise, Gobiocypris rarus (a freshwater species of cyprinid fish endemic to China), and Leptobotia elongata (a species of botiid fish), all of which have had their genomes sequenced and assembled \\u2014 the critically endangered Ochetobius elongatus had yet to have its genome assembled.The researchers assembled the chromosomal-level genome of the Ochetobius elongatus based on various sequencing technologies. According to Liang, a total of 28,674 protein-coding genes were predicted, with 28,637 genes annotated, indicating the high quality of the genome assembly.\\u0022\\u0022This is the first release of the genome information of Ochetobius elongatus. It is crucial for understanding genetic diversity, identifying unique adaptations, and formulating effective conservation strategies for the species,\\u0022\\u0022 said Lu Jianguo, the corresponding author of the research article.In future, Lu\\u0027s team plans to focus on the artificial breeding of the rare fish, aiming to achieve sustainable artificial breeding of the species.",

        "full-text": "Targeted measures have been taken to spare grassroots officials from having to participate in unnecessary meetings or write tedious reports, enabling them to focus on practical work after the central leadership prioritized tackling formalism last year, experts said.From January to November, nearly 92,000 cases of formalism were investigated nationwide, a significant increase from the previous year\\u0027s 46,000 cases, according to data from the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection and the National Commission of Supervision.During this period, approximately 135,000 officials received disciplinary or administrative punishments for their involvement in the problem, nearly double the 70,000 individuals penalized in 2023, the watchdogs\\u0027 data showed.In August, China issued its first intra-Party regulations aimed at relieving primary-level officials from unnecessary workloads by addressing redundant formalities and improving governance amid persistent red tape.The rules address a wide range of issues, including reducing excessive paperwork, meetings and inspections that hinder local officials\\u0027 ability to effectively perform their duties. They also regulate mobile applications developed for public governance.Song Wei, director of the Clean Governance Research Center at the University of Science and Technology in Beijing, said the central leadership has implemented innovative and systematic measures to crack down on formalism. These efforts aim to reduce the burden on grassroots officials and encourage them to take greater responsibility in addressing the practical problems of people.He emphasized the importance of persistently monitoring and addressing emerging manifestations such as \\u0022\\u0022vanity projects\\u0022\\u0022 and \\u0022\\u0022formalism at the fingertips\\u0022\\u0022 to create a strong deterrent effect.In a case highlighted by the CCDI last year, the city of Qiqihar in Heilongjiang province set a target for \\u0022\\u0022likes\\u0022\\u0022 during an online city-ranking activity where netizens voted for their favorite cities.The city issued notices requiring counties and units to regularly report the \\u0022\\u0022likes\\u0022\\u0022 they received and explicitly mandated that the participation rate in each district should not be less than 10 percent of the total population.Some counties imposed a daily quota of 500 \\u0022\\u0022likes\\u0022\\u0022 per community. Schools and hospitals required teachers, students, parents, doctors and nurses to participate, with teachers uploading photos to prove their classes had submitted their \\u0022\\u0022likes\\u0022\\u0022.This practice of assigning such box-ticking tasks sparked discontent among grassroots workers and the public, the CCDI said, revealing issues in some areas where tasks are pushed through administrative orders without regard for their feasibility.Last year, government departments across several regions in China shut down official social media accounts and mobile apps due to issues such as redundancy and poor content and management.Lyu Dewen, a sociology professor at Wuhan University in Hubei province, noted that when the government began promoting digital development, each level of government created apps for official work. However, many of these apps were unnecessary or not user-friendly.To ensure high usage rates, some departments introduced ranking assessments, which often evolved into new forms of formalism, he said.\\u0022\\u0022The systems of some apps require a photo to be uploaded at a certain work stage before the next step can proceed, forcing grassroots officials to leave traces in the apps,\\u0022\\u0022 he added.In his research, Lyu found that while certain government apps for filing reports and submitting data have indeed brought convenience, many require overlapping information, significantly increasing the workload for grassroots cadres.Grassroots officials are expected to address the public\\u0027s issues face-to-face, Lyu said. However, unnecessary systems and apps often constrain them, as they must first report within the system.To combat formalism, Lyu suggested it is inadvisable to rush digitalization at the grassroots level at present.",
        "ft_llama_summary": "China has taken measures to reduce formalism in government work, allowing grassroots officials to focus on practical work. The country has seen a significant increase in formalism cases, with nearly 92,000 cases investigated nationwide from January to November, up from 46,000 cases in the previous year. The measures aim to reduce the burden on officials and encourage them to address practical problems.",
        "manual_gpt_summary": "From January to November, nearly 92,000 cases of formalism were investigated in China, nearly double the previous year. Measures, including new intra-Party regulations in August, aim to reduce unnecessary tasks for grassroots officials. This includes cutting excessive meetings, reports, and mobile apps, and addressing issues like \\u0022\\u0022vanity projects\\u0022\\u0022 and formalism at the fingertips."

        "full-text": "BEIJING - China\\u0027s top disciplinary agency is set to convene a pivotal plenary session from Jan 6 to 8, where it will outline key priorities in the fight against corruption for the year ahead.In a recent meeting, Chinese leadership assessed the country\\u0027s current anti-corruption landscape, emphasizing the need for \\u0022\\u0022exceptional\\u0022\\u0022 clarity of purpose and resolve in the fight against graft, with zero tolerance for complacency or leniency.Over the past decade, China has maintained an unprecedented anti-corruption campaign, marked by the investigation of a record number of high-ranking officials and its broad impact across various sectors.Today, this relentless crackdown has become the norm. People now understand that the leadership\\u0027s pledge that \\u0022\\u0022anti-corruption is an ongoing endeavor without end\\u0022\\u0022 is not mere rhetoric, but a steadfast commitment to action.China\\u0027s anti-corruption battle continues to roar. In 2024, it made waves in sectors such as finance, energy, healthcare and sports, while dismantling sophisticated forms of graft that sought to conceal themselves as legitimate market practices.According to the country\\u0027s top anti-corruption watchdog, 58 high-ranking officials under the supervision of the Communist Party of China Central Committee were probed last year.The crackdown on corruption has also intensified in areas impacting the daily lives of ordinary people. A campaign launched in April 2024 saw 433,000 low-ranking officials disciplined, with 14,000 referred for prosecution.In its ongoing efforts to track down corrupt fugitives, China has secured the return of 1,306 individuals who had fled abroad and also recovered illicit assets totaling 15.4 billion yuan ($2.1 billion) between January and November 2024.KEY SECTORS PRONE TO CORRUPTIONChina has broadened its fight against corruption in key sectors vulnerable to malpractice, including finance, energy, tobacco, pharmaceuticals, sports and infrastructure projects.Among them, the pharmaceutical sector stands out, with 52,000 cases filed and 2,634 individuals referred to prosecutors. These individuals were allegedly implicated in corrupt practices, including accepting kickbacks, defrauding medical insurance funds, and manipulating appointment slots for profit, according to a report by the National Supervisory Commission.The crackdown on misconduct in this sector has delivered tangible results, with medical insurance departments recovering 24.2 billion yuan in misappropriated funds. In 2024, compared to 2022, average discharge costs in public hospitals dropped by 5.7 percent, while medication costs fell by 12.1 percent.Sports is another key focus of the anti-corruption drive. In May 2024, Gou Zhongwen, former head of the General Administration of Sport (GAS), was placed under investigation. Gou was subsequently arrested in December last year on charges of bribery and abuse of power.Several high-ranking sports officials stood trial in 2024, including Du Zhaocai, former deputy head of the GAS, who was sentenced to 14 years in prison, and Li Tie, former head coach of the national men\\u0027s football team and a renowned former player, who received a 20-year sentence.SOPHISTICATED CORRUPTION TACTICSAs corruption tactics evolve, China\\u0027s anti-corruption efforts face new challenges. Corruption modus operandi has shifted from traditional forms, such as accepting cash and real estate bribes, to more complex schemes involving the acquisition of shares and paid services in exchange for illegal favors.Some corrupt practices are increasingly being disguised as legitimate activities, with examples including private lending and speculative trading. Others involve the receipt of assets through shadow companies or third-party holdings.Additionally, some officials may provide benefits while in office but only accept bribes after retirement, creating a delay between the corrupt act and the reward.In one case, Fan Yifei, former vice governor of the People\\u0027s Bank of China, used his brother\\u0027s investment company to secretly amass wealth. Rather than offering cash, bribe-givers provided fake investment projects, with his brother\\u0027s company profiting from fraudulent agreements that required no actual money.\\u0022\\u0022A businessman might offer me money directly, and I\\u0027d refuse. But if he gives it in the form of stocks or other assets, not directly to me but to my family, that\\u0027s a whole different matter,\\u0022\\u0022 Fan confessed, highlighting why such corrupt practices are much harder to trace.In response, anti-corruption agencies have strengthened collaboration with departments of public security, taxation and auditing, leveraging advanced technologies such as big data and cloud computing to uncover deeply entrenched corruption.China has also stepped up efforts to punish those who offer bribes. In the first three quarters of 2024, anti-graft watchdogs investigated 19,000 individuals for offering bribes and referred 2,972 for prosecution.Offering of bribes is a key factor in the persistence of corruption, said Song Wei, deputy head of the Beijing research base for integrity, adding that addressing both bribe-taking and bribe-giving is crucial for effectively curbing corruption.",

Eligible students must demonstrate a frugal lifestyle alongside proving financial need.The issue of financial aid misuse has sparked debate online. A recent case at Zhejiang University drew attention after a student who received financial assistance was found to have spent considerable funds on international travel. Critics questioned whether such expenses were consistent with the purpose of the aid. The student has since been disqualified from receiving the scholarship.One netizen shared, \\u0022\\u0022I used to be a beneficiary of State-level financial aid. The primary purpose of the aid is to cover tuition and living expenses for students who cannot afford the cost of education and daily life.\\u0022\\u0022In response to rising concerns over financial aid allocation, China increased the amount of scholarships and financial support available to students this October.Under a new initiative by the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Education, and the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security, students facing financial difficulties will now receive an average of 3,700 yuan ($508) annually, up from 3,300 yuan ($453) in previous years.",

This limited understanding inadvertently leads to the erosion of rural culture, she added.Mayyada Abu Jaber, international jury of UNESCO Prize for Girls\\u0027 and Women\\u0027s Education, pointed out that the urban-rural divide, gender disparity and outdated education are the three major obstacles hindering rural sustainable development.Qiu Jiansheng, director of the Research Center of Rural Construction and Community Building at Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University, emphasized the necessity to restore both economic and cultural confidence in rural areas. He stressed that localized strategies should be employed to establish targeted mutual aid systems of rural education.Jordan Naidoo, former director of the UNESCO Kabul Office and the Division of Education 2030 Support and Coordination at the UNESCO headquarters, called for lifelong, life-wide and life-deep learning, and highlighted the role of cross-sectoral collaboration and youth action in rural sustainable development.Luo Yixian, president of the association, said Zigen has invested over 100 million yuan ($13.8 million) in rural development initiatives. To date, it has helped more than 8,000 girls complete compulsory education and has implemented girls\\u0027 sex education and women\\u0027s empowerment training in rural areas.During the seminar, Qi Xinjian, a specialist at the UNESCO International Research and Training Centre for Rural Education, launched a global research project on youth and social development. The three-year research program will focus on different themes each year, aiming to pool efforts to support social development and provide broader perspectives and deeper insights for young activists in universities worldwide, Qi said.On Sunday, the UNESCO INRULED celebrated its 30th anniversary, unveiling a series of achievements and its eight key publications for 2024.During the event, 36 experts and scholars from China and abroad were appointed as strategic advisors, academic advisors and consulting experts for INRULED.Their future work will highlight promoting rural sustainable development through initiatives such as improving rural education with high-quality teachers and leveraging mathematics and technology for rural education and development.Established by the Chinese government and UNESCO under Beijing Normal University, the center carries the mission of promoting socioeconomic sustainable development in rural areas worldwide, particularly in developing countries, through education, said BNU president Yu Jihong.The center has built platforms for policy dialogue, organized a series of seminars and participated in international discussions to explore rural education issues over the past three decades, Yu said.",

We have cheered for victories and consoled those who fell short.But beyond the triumphs and defeats, there is something more to admire: the poised and energetic demeanor of China\\u0027s young athletes, coupled with their astonishing record-breaking achievements.On Aug 4, 21-year-old Zheng Qinwen made history for Chinese tennis by winning the first gold medal in women\\u0027s singles for both China and Asia. Just the following day, the young Chinese swimming team ended the US\\u0027s decadeslong unbeaten streak in the men\\u0027s 4x100m medley relay, finishing in three minutes and 27.46 seconds.This extraordinary progress in nontraditional sports is particularly noteworthy because it adds to a nation\\u0027s overall sporting prowess.By winning gold medals in events once dominated by Western athletes, these young competitors have demonstrated a remarkable improvement in China\\u0027s competitive sports landscape.Equally inspiring is the positive mindset exhibited by these young athletes. They are confident and inclusive, both in competition and cross-cultural interactions, striving for excellence and breakthrough performances.Moreover, they have moved away from the \\u0022\\u0022gold medal only\\u0022\\u0022 mentality, embracing a more composed and rational approach to sports, which reflects a significant shift in their perspective.There are countless examples. From 18-year-old BMX freestyle cyclist Deng Yawen to 26-year-old swimmer Zhang Yufei, many young athletes have captivated global audiences with their self-assured approach to competition. They genuinely enjoy competing.When Zhang, China\\u0027s \\u0022\\u0022butterfly queen\\u0022\\u0022, missed out on a gold medal, she said, \\u0022\\u0022I hope this time I can have a relaxed attitude and really enjoy the Olympics.\\u0022\\u0022This shift in mindset and demeanor has moved the public focus away from just winning gold medals to appreciating the respect and glory that athletes and the Olympics truly deserve.From the 1984 Los Angeles Olympic Games to the 2024 Paris Olympic Games, from the \\u0022\\u0022post-50s\\u0022\\u0022 generation to today\\u0027s \\u0022\\u0022post-00s\\u0022\\u0022, successive generations of young Chinese athletes have repeatedly proven themselves through their inspiring performances.For Gen Z athletes, success is the goal, but they remain equally graceful in the face of failure.On the Olympic stage, these young people uphold the proud traditions of Chinese sports while showcasing a new image of a confident and open China, embodying the deep integration of Chinese values with the Olympic spirit.But what exactly is the Olympic spirit? It begins with competition but transcends mere rivalry. It\\u0027s not just about being faster, higher, stronger, but also about embracing sports with a positive attitude. It\\u0027s sportsmanship that conveys the deeper meaning of athletics to humanity, making the Olympic Games the pinnacle of global sports.",

The children watch cheerfully, bursting into laughter as one of the robots accidentally falls.The bus was not a performance troupe of any kind but rather a mobile science class jointly organized by the Ministry of Education, the China Science and Technology Museum and the social media platform Douyin, aiming to sow seeds of passion for science among children in the country\\u0027s vast rural areas.Since February, thanks to the joint initiative, scientists, science educators and science museum staff have walked into 18 town schools in the Guangxi Zhuang autonomous region and Henan and Gansu provinces.Astrophysicist Wu Xiangping, who has traversed China\\u0027s remote middle and western regions for popular science work, says that rural children are just as curious as their urban peers in science classes, calling for more scientific education resources in remote areas.In May last year, the education ministry and other departments released a document on the country\\u0027s plans to strengthen scientific education in primary and secondary schools, vowing to ensure that a more sound system will be in place in three to five years.Lyu Guofan, chairman of the Henan Association for Science and Technology, says that rural areas are mostly faced with a shortage of qualified teachers and equipment for scientific education.A survey conducted by the ministry in 2021 covering 31 provincial-level regions across the country showed that science teachers at primary schools mostly lack related educational backgrounds.In June 2021, the State Council issued an action plan for improving the scientific quality of nationals from 2021 to 2035, vowing to expand the recruitment of college students majoring in scientific education and strengthen online training of science teachers. According to the document, 100,000 science tutors would be trained each year at the grassroots level.Many schools have been exploring their own methods for improving scientific education. Some experts suggest that schools start with real situations in the countryside, such as learning more about farm crops and poultry as a first step.Zhang Jiantao, a teacher at a town school in Gushi county, Henan, gained notable fame for his novel science classes by turning rubbish bins into drones and water bottles into \\u0022\\u0022water-propelled rockets\\u0022\\u0022.A former mathematics teacher, Zhang volunteered to focus on teaching science to the school\\u0027s more curious students, who are mostly left behind by their city-bound working parents in the care of grandparents.\\u0022\\u0022The kids love conducting experiments,\\u0022\\u0022 Zhang says.\\u0022\\u0022After doing experiments together, they are more open to me and focus better in classes.",

They are also well-designed and good quality, and they are liked by my friends and colleagues too,\\u0022\\u0022 says Wang Xinyue, a resident of Shenzhen.Makeshift handbags like the \\u0022\\u0022Shenzhen bag\\u0022\\u0022 are also quite common among young people in big cities like Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou, provincial capital of Guangdong. People find the bags practical, wearable and fashionable, and they can be carried on the shoulder or the back. Some bags even have a thermal insulation coating, and are suitable for both men and women and different age groups.This emerging trend reveals a new attitude to consumption as young people in China begin to pursue a simple and shared life, with consumers no longer blindly pursuing brand names as a status symbol, but advocating a simple and low-carbon lifestyle.In addition to the handbags, and regardless of their monthly incomes, many young people are living more casually, in line with a \\u0022\\u0022good enough mentality\\u0022\\u0022. Loose T-shirts, Crocs, and canvas bags are basically standard mode. These simple, pragmatic products have become trendsetters.\\u0022\\u0022Consumers today are becoming more mature and rational. They are pursuing smarter consumption through rational consideration and calculation to find the cheapest, most practical, cost-effective way of shopping,\\u0022\\u0022 says Wang Ning, a sociology professor at Nanjing\\u0027s Southeast University.Economists believe that China\\u0027s Generation Z no longer blindly pursues brands and luxury goods or buys things for the sake of name and status. Instead, they pay more attention to their actual needs, quality, and experience of buying, and prefer sharing and secondhand purchases. They also advocate environmental protection and sustainable consumption.A report released by database query platform TianYanCha.com confirms that rational and pragmatic decisions such as \\u0022\\u0022what I buy is what I really need\\u0022\\u0022 have become mainstream.Price-conscious Chinese consumers have also begun to place a greater emphasis on their inner selves. Driven by rational consumption, many young people no longer scrimp and save to buy a brand-name bag, and the money they save is used on self-improvement.The new handbag trend has also created business opportunities. Reusing packaging used for food brands as handbags results in mobile advertising for the associated brands, and the phenomenon of the \\u0022\\u0022Shenzhen Bag\\u0022\\u0022 has also benefited paper bag manufacturers.",

He is out of danger and his vital signs are stabilizing,\\u0022\\u0022 says Yang Yuexia, who is in charge of the neonatology department at the Urumqi Children\\u0027s Hospital.\\u0022\\u0022Knowing that my baby was severely ill, I felt like the sky was falling,\\u0022\\u0022 Mukaram Yusup, the infant\\u0027s mother, recalls.Faced with their situation, the parents and doctors made a phone call to Urumqi Children\\u0027s Hospital at about 5:30 pm on June 30, saying they needed an urgent intercity hospital transfer for the infant.Upon receiving the notice, the Urumqi Children\\u0027s Hospital established a three-person team and prepared the medical equipment the boy would require, including respirators, fearing that the baby would develop breathing difficulties and other emergency conditions during his long trip.The doctors in Hami had also brought him some medicine that could be used in case of further emergency before his departure.The hospital preparations were all set. However, a new problem emerged: How could they transport the patient to Urumqi in a timely manner without exacerbating his condition?There are no direct flights between the two locations, and it would take at least eight hours for an ambulance to travel by road. On that day, temperatures in some areas along the route were set to exceed 40 C, which would pose a risk to the infant, with the long-distance transfer potentially providing a double blow, according to doctors.They then turned to Xinjiang\\u0027s railway authorities for help and boarded an Urumqi-bound bullet train, together with the Hami doctors, at around 8:20 pm.Upon receiving notice, railway authorities activated an emergency response mechanism.\\u0022\\u0022To take better care of them during the trip, we brought the mother a blanket and asked a mechanic aboard to adjust the temperature of their carriage to keep them warm,\\u0022\\u0022 says Wang Juan from China Railway Urumqi Group Co.Wang says they also reassured the mother by sharing with her real-time locations of the train. \\u0022\\u0022We asked her many times, \\u0027What can we do for you and your baby?\\u0027 But she didn\\u0027t ask for a lot, worrying about putting us to any trouble.\\u0022\\u0022At 11:10 pm, the train arrived at Urumqi station, where an ambulance was already waiting at the platform. With the coordination of local traffic police, the vehicle delivered them to the hospital as quickly as it could.\\u0022\\u0022When the patient was transferred to the hospital at about 11:40 pm, he was in serious condition\\uff0dhis breathing was short and his heart rate was higher than normal,\\u0022\\u0022 says Yang, who picked him up at the station. They gave the infant treatment sessions while organizing multidisciplinary consultations.Following the operation, performed by approximately nine medical workers, which lasted from 2:30 am to 4:20 am, the infant finally pulled through and was sent to the neonatal intensive care unit.The mother says the attending doctor shared with them daily information on the boy\\u0027s recovery through the messaging app WeChat. \\u0022\\u0022According to the recent feedback, our baby is recovering well, his ventilator has been removed, and he will be able to drink breast milk in a few days.\\u0022\\u0022According to Yang, the infant is recovering, though, depending on his condition, a second surgery might be necessary.The lifesaving \\u0022\\u0022relay race\\u0022\\u0022 lasted for some 11 hours, and the joint effort of the various departments involved has been met with gratitude.\\u0022\\u0022I couldn\\u0027t imagine how I would have survived this difficult time without the support and coordination from railway and hospital authorities in both Hami and Urumqi,\\u0022\\u0022 Mukaram Yusup says.The mother adds that, although she can\\u0027t remember the names of many of the people who had helped her, they are remembered in her heart. \\u0022\\u0022I would say thank you to them in person if I could.",

My grandfather could actually have been considered to be quite \\u0022\\u0022green-fingered\\u0022\\u0022, as there were always impressive blooms in his garden, and, in fact, he won a number of prizes in his community for keeping such a nice garden.Not only was it a nice garden in the visual sense, but the vegetables and fruit that he grew in it were also often on the dinner table at his home, so it was also a very practical garden. This was a result of the times he and millions others grew up in difficult circumstances during the Great Depression of the 1930s, in which vegetables grown in gardens and allotments helped people supplement their meager incomes.I had just been a passive admirer of the work done by him and gardeners generally until quite recently, when I decided to turn my hand to cultivating some plants.Unlike my grandfather, I don\\u0027t have a large garden to do this. Like millions of other people, I only have a small balcony on which to conduct my horticultural activities, but that has not discouraged me in the slightest.It\\u0027s possible to make a nice \\u0022\\u0022garden\\u0022\\u0022 even in the most limited space, but one must also limit one\\u0027s ambitions to a certain extent.I had already attempted to grow some flowers, but couldn\\u0027t tell the difference between those and weeds, so my attention and efforts then turned to something much more practical: vegetables.The next time you eat a tomato, just consider what\\u0027s inside it when you cut it open: a multitude of little seeds, a ready-made source of new life.So, I decided to take the seeds of one humble little tomato and plant them in a number of pots. After several weeks, I was amazed by the results. I now have about 15 tomato plants on my balcony in different stages of growth.It\\u0027s a rewarding sight to see this greenery on my balcony. Not only does it look nice, it\\u0027s also a good feeling that I have made my own little contribution to nature, and I keep my fingers crossed that one day this little bit of nature in my home will give me something very practical indeed: some nice tasty tomatoes.And in this day and age in which we have such fast-paced lives and rely on modern technology for so much, it\\u0027s very rewarding to be engaging in a practice which is as old as time itself, as plant life is essentially the most basic and oldest \\u0022\\u0022technology\\u0022\\u0022 on our planet.Even if you don\\u0027t consider yourself to have \\u0022\\u0022green fingers\\u0022\\u0022, it is something that\\u0027s well worth having a try of\\uff0dyou could be amazed by the results.",

        "full-text": "Geodesic vortex detection on curved surfaces: Analyzing the 2002 austral stratospheric polar vortex warming eventtext to summarize: Geodesic vortex detection is a tool in nonlinear dynamical systems to objectivelyidentify transient vortices with flow-invariant boundaries that defy the typical deformation found in 2-d turbulence. Initially formulated for flows on the Euclidean plane withCartesian coordinates, we have extended this technique to flows on 2-d Riemannianmanifolds with arbitrary coordinates. This extension required the further formulationof the concept of objectivity on manifolds. Moreover, a recently proposed birth-anddeath vortex framing algorithm, based on geodesic detection, has been adapted toaddress the limited temporal validity of 2-d motion in otherwise three-dimensionalflows, like those found in the Earth\\u2019s stratosphere. With these adaptations, we focusedon the Lagrangian, i.e., kinematic, aspects of the austral stratospheric polar vortexduring the exceptional sudden warming event of 2002, which resulted in the vortexsplitting. This study involved applying geodesic vortex detection to isentropic windsfrom reanalysis data. We provide a detailed analysis of the vortex\\u2019s life cycle, covering its birth, the splitting process, and its eventual death. In addition, we offer newkinematic insights into ozone depletion within the vortex.Geodesic vortex detection is a method for observer-independent (objective)identification from 2-d velocity data of vortices characterized by material (flowinvariant) boundaries that resist stretching over finite time, a notion formulatedas a variational problem, hence the nomenclature. In this paper, geodesic vortex detection has been extended to operate on curved surfaces (manifolds), anda recently developed birth-and-death vortex framing algorithm derived fromthis method has been adapted to address the limited durational applicability ofthe 2-d motion assumption, a common practice in the Earth\\u2019s stratosphere. Weused this modification to fully characterize the life cycle, from birth to death,of the austral stratospheric polar vortex during the sudden warming event thatled to its splitting in 2002. We also used it to provide novel kinematic perspectives into the mechanisms by which air within the vortex depletes ozone.This analysis was carried out by examining wind velocity data from a reanalysis system (integrating past short-range forecasts with observations via dataassimilation) on a constant potential temperature (i.e., isentropic) surface.",

        "full-text": "1 IntroductionGrey matter (GM) is composed of a range of cells, mainly differentiated intoneuronal and glial cells, featuring a plethora of morphological characteristics.Neurons are fundamental functional units of the nervous system, specialized in the transmission and integration of electrical and chemical signals within thebrain. Supporting the neurons are the glial cells (e.g. astrocites, microglia andolignodendracytes) that are crucial in maintaining the health and functionalityof neurons.First studied in depth by Ramon y Cajal in the late 19th century [1], neuronalmorphology offers insights into the complex structure and function of the brain.Neurons come in various shapes and sizes, tailored for their respective functions[2]. Neurons can be classified according to their morphological, molecular, andphysiological characteristics [3]. Both neurons and glia have similar structures,both having a central cell body (or soma) and branching projections, and showremarkable diversity and variability depending on the brain region [4, 5], e.g.,from the complex branching patterns of Purkinje cells in the cerebellum to themore simple granule cells of the cerebral cortex.The brain contains about 86 billion neural1cells [6]. Cortical GM is roughlyconstituted of 10\\u201340% cell bodies (soma) of neural cells; 40\\u201375% neurites: neuronal dendrites, short-range intra-cortical axons, the stems of long-range axonsextending into the WM and glial cell projections which intermingle with eachother to form a dense and complex network; 15\\u201330% highly tortuous extracellular space (ECS); and 1\\u20135% vasculature [7, 8, 9]. In adults, the glia toneuron ratio is 1.32/1.40 for males/females respectively. The proportion of glialcells (by cell count) was estimated to be 77% oligodendrocytes, 17% astrocytesand 6% microglia [10, 11].The ECS occupies a volume fraction of 15-30% in normal adult brain tissue, with a typical value of 20%, that falls to 5% during global ischemia(the expected state during classical fixation) [12]. The ECS has an averagetortuosity (defined as the ratio between the true diffusion coefficient and the effective diffusivity of small molecules such as inulin and sucrose) of 2-3 [12], dueto its labyrinthine porous matrix, the presence of long-chain macromolecules,transient trapping in dead-space microdomains, and transient physical-chemicalinteraction with the cellular membranes. The width of the ECS of the braincortex is 40-120 nm [13], although this is less established because chemicalsused in the processing of the tissue for the display introduce shrinkage effectsthat can range from 1-65% [14]. The average neuron-microvessel distance inbrain GM is 20 \\u00b5m [15].The morphology of neurons and glia is revealed through staining and microscopy techniques such as confocal or electron microscopy [16, 17, 18], whichcan image cellular structures with very high resolution (down to a few nanometers) [19]. However, currently there are no means to directly observe the cellularmicrostructure in vivo and without invasively using imaging techniques, suchas Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), as the cellular scale (on micrometers)lies beyond the resolution of clinical MRI, generally on the mm scale [20]. Withmany neurological conditions, including aging [21], altering the brain structureon this cellular scale, there is a strong incentive to develop means of revealing the morphology of neural cells, in-vivo.Given its sensitivity to the micrometer length scale, diffusion-weighted MRI(dMRI) is a promising technique to address the resolution limit of MRI andcharacterize the brain structure in vivo at the cellular scale, that is, the microstructure. However, this sensitivity is indirect and biophysical modelling ofthe dMRI signal in the brain tissue is essential to quantify histologically meaningful features of the cellular structure and gain specificity to their changes.To this end, the microstructure imaging paradigm has been introduced over adecade ago [14]: the approach voxel-wise fits a biophysical model to the setof signals obtained from images acquired with different sensitivities, yieldingmodel parameter maps proxy of the corresponding microstructural features.Successful examples of the microstructure imaging paradigm include Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) [22], the Neurite Orientation Dispersion and DensityImaging (NODDI) [23] and the White Matter Tract Integrity (WMTI) [24] tocharacterise the diffusion of water within white matter (WM), revealing insightinto the structure of axonal bundle tracks and other anatomical features, suchas axon diameter [25, 26], opening new and exciting opportunities in the fieldof neuroscience.Following the success of dMRI in WM, there has been a significant increasein interest in its application in GM, with the hopes of characterizing the cellularmorphology within the brain in vivo. So far, dMRI has been used to differentiatedifferent areas of cortical grey matter and reveal laminar structure within greymatter [27]. Great effort has been made to develop also models to better describethe diffusion signal within GM and reveal anatomical information about themicrostructure, such as the Soma And Neurite Density Imaging (SANDI) [28] tocharacterize soma and neurite density, the Neurite EXchange Imaging (NEXI)[29] and the Standard Mmodel with EXchange (SMEX) [30] to characterizethe water permeative exchange between neurites and extracellular space, andcombinations of these, such as SANDI with exchange (SANDIx) [30].While substantial effort has been made to design, validate, and translate toclinics biophysical models for WM microstructure imaging [14, 31, 32], the GMcounterpart is lagging. This is due to the greater complexity of the tissue, whichrenders the design of biophysical models for GM microstructure imaging morechallenging [33].To design sensible biophysical models and appropriate dMRI acquisitionsfor GM, it is critical to identify which relevant microstructural features of thecomplex GM tissue can be measured, how they can be estimated accuratelyand how such estimates can be validated. It is also very helpful to identify thetypical values of such relevant features. With cellular morphology varying bycell type as well as brain region, there is a necessity for a thorough analysis ofcharacteristics based on these criteria. Whilst substantial effort has been puttowards the fine characterisation of WM axonal morphology there is yet to bethe same level of in-depth analysis dedicated to GM cellular morphology.Here we aim to correct this imbalance with a comprehensive analysis ofGM cellular morphology, looking at structural and topological morphology,and shape descriptors of over 3000 real three dimensional reconstructions from mouse, rat, monkey, and human brain cortex.The paper is organized as following. We first provide quantitative information on the anatomy of brain GM tissue at the cellular scale, which is theprimary target for microstructure imaging through dMRI. We characterize themorphology of neural cells using structural, topological and shape descriptors.We then review the range of dMRI measurements and biophysical models available to probe this anatomy and highilight limitations and caveats, ultimatelyproviding guidelines on how to model dMRI signals in GM.",

        "full-text": "A stochastic interacting particle system (IPS) is a large number of particles or agents interacting throughnonlinear dynamics while being subject to stochastic noise. From microscopic molecular motions to macroscopic phenomena in artificial intelligence, interacting particle systems are ubiquitous both in nature and insocial science. Traditional applications range from collective cell migration to human population dynamics,while emerging applications in large language models (LLMs) and multi-agent AI systems open up newdirections for this framework[1]. In these AI systems, individual agents, whether different instances of language models or specialized AI agents, interact and collaborate through complex mechanisms to accomplishtasks, exhibiting collective behaviors quite similar to that of classical collective systems.Mining and modeling such systems requires identifying possible interaction mechanisms between individuals. However, these interaction rules are usually unknown and need to be inferred from observed data This belongs to the class of inverse problems, which however is particularly difficult in the current case, sincethe IPS involves a large number of interacting agents under the impacts of intrinsic and extrinsic stochasticeffects.In recent years, data-driven approaches have become a powerful tool for addressing these issues. Forexample, SINDy and its variants have been successfully applied to discover governing equations in differentfields[2]. They identify sparse representations of nonlinear dynamical systems from data, often revealinginterpretable physical laws. Data-driven methods have also been applied to parameter inference and modeldiscovery for interacting particle systems[3, 4, 5]. Peng et al. discussed the potential of combining multiscale modeling with machine learning. By reviewing some typical case studies, they demonstrated the striking power of machine learning to extract macro- behaviors from micro-data[6]. The research by Vlachaset al. focused on learning effective models of complex systems. They successfully extracted simplifiedmacroscopic models from microscopic simulation data by using machine learning techniques, significantlyenhancing the understanding and simulation efficiency of complex systems[7]. A continuum descriptionis essential for understanding the collective phenomena in active matters. By using a physically informeddata-driven approach, Golden et al. constructed a complete mathematical model of an active nematic basedon experimental data, revealing dynamics controlled by active and friction stresses with no role for elasticeffects[8].In the above mentioned studies, the mean-field theory plays a role in analyzing the complex dynamicsof IPS, providing a simplified framework to describe the macroscopic behaviors arising from microscopicinteractions[9, 10]. Despite its success, deriving accurate mean-field equations for interacting particle systems remains a challenging task, especially under dynamically changing environments[11].In this paper, we propose a two-phase method for learning the interaction kernels of IPS. Our startingpoint is the stochastic trajectories of every particle in the IPS, which are obtained either by experimentalmeasurements or by numerical simulations. Then using the kernel density estimation approach, the empirical distribution function is constructed, which is supposed to be the solution to the corresponding mean-fieldequation. The interaction kernel function constitutes an essential part of the mean-field equation and determines the collective dynamics of the IPS. Now we apply importance sampling with an adaptive thresholdstrategy to identify the key terms in the interaction kernel, which later will be fine-tuned by making use ofthe whole dataset. This is the key steps of our method.To provide a detailed explanation on the algorithms of our method, as well as applications to severalconcrete examples, the remainder of the paper is structured as follows: Section 2 establishes the theoreticalfoundation for the mean-field equations and their connections to the stochastic interacting particle systems.Section 3 presents our Two-Phase methodology for learning interaction kernels in detail. In Section 4, wetest our approach through a series of numerical experiments. The last section concludes with a summary ofthe findings and potential future directions.",

        "full-text": "Quantum information systems based on superconducting (SC) qubits are a viable path towards large-scale quantum computing, owing to lithographic production of sizeable qubit networks combined with continuous improvements in gate and readout fidelity [1,2]. As these systems continue to increase to greater numbers of physical qubits, there is a growing need to implement large-scale qubit drive and state readout. SC qubits rely on cryogenic delivery ofcarefully shaped microwave pulses to control and readout the quantum state of each qubit. Presently, these pulses are generated at room temperature and routed through heavily filtered and attenuated coaxial transmission lines to the qubits held at ~10 mK temperatures. In order to reach the million-qubit scale required for truly transformational quantum computing [3], one is confronted with the monumental task of managing the heat load, cost and complexity of millions of coaxial microwave signal lines. Perhaps the most fundamental of these challenges is the heat load, where the cooling power of 20 \\uf06dW of a typical dilution refrigerator would limit the number of coaxial lines to a few thousand [4]. The clear need for an alternative architecture has led to the exploration of other means of large-scale qubit drive and readout, including optical interconnects, single flux quantum drive and cryogenic CMOS [5\\u20139].Optical interconnects offer a compelling scaling solution to achieve qubit numbers well beyond what is possible with coaxial cabling. Found wherever large amounts of information need to be transferred at high rates, optical interconnects provide large intrinsic bandwidth, long reach, and low noise. When applied to the control and readout of superconducting qubits, optical interconnects additionally leverage the extremely low thermal conductivity of optical fibers (about 1000x less than coaxial cable), enabling the connection of a million or more qubits without a significant passive heat load. An initial demonstration has shown the viability of this approach, where an optical interconnect delivered control and readout pulses to a single 3D transmon qubit [5].To advance cryogenic optical interconnects beyond proof-of-principle demonstration and towards large-number scaling, several advancements are desirable. First, to take advantage of telecommunications investments in lasers, modulators, and other optical components, cryogenic photodetectors that operate in a wide wavelength range that extends into the telecommunications C-band (1530 nm to 1565 nm) and L-band (1565 nm to 1625 nm) are needed. Due to the bandgap shift to shorter wavelengths at cryogenic temperatures, this will require a move away from the standard InGaAs detectors that are the workhorse of C- and Lband telecommunications. Second, signal multiplexing schemes will need to be developed that can deliver multiple microwave control and readout signals while minimizing the required optical power and associated heat load. As discussed further below, this implies a departure from direct modulation of a CW laser that was demonstrated in [5]. Third, the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of each photonically delivered microwave signal should be optimized. With photodetection comes photocurrent shot noise that reduces the SNR compared to the coherent state of the microwave field. This noise can cause errors in qubit drive and readout in excess over attenuated coaxial lines. As this noise is proportional to the optical power, modulation schemes that deliver the highest microwave power for a given optical power are preferred.Here we work towards these goals by combining short optical pulse detection for reduced heat load and improved SNR with an extended-InGaAs photodiode at cryogenic temperaturesfor operation in the optical C- and L-bands. We demonstrate high responsivity at temperatures of 4 K and 20 mK with 1550 nm illumination, representing, to the best of our knowledge, the first experimental demonstration of the utility of extended-InGaAs for 20 mK applications of photonically generated microwave signals. Furthermore, we use short pulse illumination to generate a multiplicity of microwave carriers at 20 mK, any of which can be selected and used for qubit drive or readout. Importantly, generation of several microwave carriers with short pulse detection requires less optical power than generating just a single carrier with modulated CW laser light. We then explore the advantages of short pulse detection over the detection of modulated-CW laser light in terms of SNR, with careful measurement of the shot noise-limited amplitude and phase noise of a microwave carrier. For the same average photocurrent, we show an improvement of 20 dB in the microwave phase noise when using short pulse detection compared to modulated-CW detection. This is the largest phase noise difference demonstrated to date, either cryogenic or room temperature. Finally, we discuss how multiple microwave tones may be utilized simultaneously for multiple qubits from the detection of a single train of optical pulses, with a demonstration of simultaneous generation of microwave pulses at carrier frequencies of 1 GHz and 3 GHz.",

The first one isthe so-called As Low As Reasonably Achievable (ALARA) principle [57]. It means thatthe object scanning process needs to be controlled to reduce the radiation dose while thevolume data should be recovered with as high quality as possible. However, the decrease inmeasured data will lead to a more seriously ill-posed inverse problem. Therefore, radiationdose reduction requirements lead to more challenging problems in mathematical modelingand numerical algorithm design for 3DCT imaging.

The larger training data volume andlarger models impose higher requirements on training hardware. Previously, engineers could train models on a singleNeural network Processing Unit (NPU), but now traininglarge models requires multiple servers or even a large training cluster.Collaborating such a large cluster to train a large languagemodel is very delicate and complex. Designers need to carefully consider how to allocate models to different NPUsand use extra ones to process data in parallel to accelerate training. Many advanced distributed training methods,such as tensor parallelism(Dean et al. 2012; Shoeybi et al.2019), pipeline parallelism(Huang et al. 2019) and data parallelism(Li et al. 2014a,b), are proposed. Meanwhile, aiming to develop more scalable and efficient training processes,distributed training framework such as Megatron(Narayananet al. 2021b), DeepSpeed(Rasley et al. 2020) and ModelLink(Ascend 2024b) are designed.

All rights reserved.number of training hyperparameters introduced by multipleparallel strategies, these systems do not provide the basis forhyperparameter selection, but merely provide recommendedempirical values. This makes it difficult for users to selecthyperparameters for their own models.The suboptimal parallel strategy can lead to increasedtraining time, which means additional costs and is expensivein the development of high cost large-scale language models. In the absence of guidance, users often need to do a lotof pre-experiments to determine a set of hyperparameters,which also means wasted time and increased costs.Based on this dilemma, some work provides hyperparameter search strategies for these systems(Chen et al. 2024;Isaev et al. 2023; Miao et al. 2022). However, due to thecomplexity of parallel frameworks, finding the globally optimal parallel strategy quickly and accurately remains a challenge. In this article, we propose an automatic planning algorithm for finding the optimal parallel strategy. Our algorithm first simulates the training duration, and by analyzingand modeling at the operator level, we can achieve an average estimation accuracy of 96% for the training time. Then,based on the simulation model, we establish a pruning strategy that can prune 99% of the search space, making it easyfor us to enumerate the most efficient parallel strategies.Unlike previous work, our algorithm covers a more comprehensive range of parallel hyperparameters, includingterms such as micro batch size and global batch size thatare often overlooked.

        "full-text": "1 Abstract Free surface and granular fluid mechanics problems combine the challenges of fluid dynamics with aspectsof granular behaviour. This type of problem is particularly relevant in contexts such as the flow ofsediments in rivers, the movement of granular soils in reservoirs, or the interactions between a fluid andgranular materials in industrial processes such as silos. The numerical simulation of these phenomenais challenging because the solution depends not only on the multiple phases that strongly interact witheach other, but also on the need to describe the geometric evolution of the different interfaces. Thispaper presents an approach to the simulation of fluid-granular phenomena involving strongly deformingfree surfaces. The Discrete Element Method (DEM) is combined with the Particle Finite ElementMethod (PFEM) and the fluid-grain interface is treated by a two-way coupling between the two phases.The fluid-air interface is solved by a free surface model. The geometric and topological variations aretherefore naturally provided by the full Lagrangian description of all phases. The approach is validatedon benchmark test cases such as two-phase dam failures and then applied to a real landslide problem.2 IntroductionFluid mechanics problems involving free surfaces and grains are multifaceted phenomena that require adeep understanding of fluid dynamics and granular interactions. They are particularly relevant to civilengineering, earth science, and many industrial applications. For example, let us consider landslides. These natural phenomena often have catastrophic consequences for people, and understanding the dynamics and predicting the potential impact in advance canhelp prevent the worst. Landslides occur when soils on steep slopes become unstable. In some cases,these steep hillsides are located above water basins, resulting in a hard impact of the soil on the water,causing significant impulse waves on the water. In other cases, known as submarine landslides, the soil detaches below the water level, creating waves on the water surface. Both cases can be referred to aslandslide tsunamis [37], and it remains a difficult challenge to simulate the creation of these waves nearthe source, in order to predict their propagation[1]. In these phenomena, the two main interfaces aresolid-fluid between the moving soil and water, and fluid-air at the surface of the water. Figure 1 is anillustration of the Lituya Bay landslide and tsunami, a case that will be studied in this work. Thisillustrates the complexity of the two types of interfaces.The numerical simulation of the evolution of these multiple strongly interacting interfaces is difficultbecause it is non-linear. The interaction laws between the fluid and granular phases are non-linear, butthis is not the only non-linearity. Another important non-linearity is related to the geometry of theinterfaces: we want to model moving interfaces with possible changes in topology, including nucleationand annihilation.Our problem thus has two types of interfaces corresponding to specific physical couplings. We willnow describe the state of the art in modeling these couplings individually and finally propose a newmethod that has all the right qualities to simulate all the couplings at once.",

        "full-text": "3D reconstruction in VR/AR applications enables realisticrestoration of scenes and objects, serving as a 3D form ofinformation present that provides users with a more immersiveexperience [1], [2]. Many devices can be used to collect datafor 3D reconstruction, including traditional RGB cameras,RGB-D cameras, LiDAR, structured light systems, etc. However, they have different limitations, including limited dynamicrange, motion blur, high power consumption, etc. [3].Neuromorphic cameras, also known as event cameras,are bio-inspired sensors responding to local brightnesschanges [3]. Each pixel in a neuromorphic camera operatesindependently and asynchronously, which differs from traditional (frame-based) RGB cameras that capture pictures witha shutter and have a fixed interval in recording video [3]\\u2013[5]. Neuromorphic cameras report changes in brightness onlywhen a threshold is reached. When there is a greater changein brightness in the scene or object, such as when the objectis moving faster, more event data will be generated. Theneuromorphic camera produces a continuous stream of events,which includes the coordinates, precise timestamp, and thepolarity of brightness change. Neuromorphic cameras in 3Dreconstruction tasks can be divided into stereo and monoculartypes. Stereo neuromorphic cameras involve multiple rigidlyconnected neuromorphic cameras, providing information frommultiple viewpoints. These methods typically perform scenescanning and produce real-time semi-dense reconstructionresults. They often follow the classical two-step stereo solution: matching disparities at the same timestamps and thentriangulating 3D points to calculate the depth information ofevery point in the scene [3], [6]. However, performing 3Dreconstruction with a monocular neuromorphic camera, whichlacks disparity information, often requires more complex computations. Such methods must be combined with the physicalprior knowledge (e.g., camera trajectories) to achieve similarresults as parallax in the stereo task. The physical prior isalways required, and it can either be obtained by simultaneousmapping with other devices or be predicted by a VisualOdometer (VO) or SLAM algorithm targeting the event stream[6]. Moreover, these methods all require a complex event-to3D pipeline [7]\\u2013[10]. The pipeline is a full workflow that optimally processes event data and reconstructs it into a 3D model,including steps such as event representation, prior estimation,computation of parallax, triangulation, depth estimation, and3D model reconstruction. Event processing pipelines are acommon research direction in these tasks. A recent studyintroduced a neural network, E2V [1], capable of directlytaking the represented event stream as input and outputtingvoxel results. This approach made progress in simplifyingthe event processing pipeline. It is also the first method toperform voxel-based 3D reconstruction using a monocularneuromorphic camera. However, it leaves substantial room forimprovement in reconstruction accuracy.In this research, we propose an end-to-end method fordense voxel 3D reconstruction using neuromorphic camerasthat eliminates the need to estimate physical priors. Ourcontributions can be summarized as:\\u2022 We propose a novel event representation method, SobelEvent Frame, which enhances edge features and restrainsredundant data in the event stream, enabling effectivelearning of 3D features.\\u2022 We propose a 3D reconstruction model designed to enhance the learning of edge features in event streams withEfficient Channel Attention, building on the approachof event-based 3D reconstruction without the need forphysical priors or pipelines.\\u2022 We propose Optimal Binarization Threshold SelectionPrinciple and suggest it as a guideline for future researchabout event-based 3D reconstruction with deep learning.",

They are composed of chains of 20 possible amino acids that stabilizeto a 3D structure based on their sequence. A protein\\u2019s sequence, structure, and function are closelyrelated: sequence largely determines structure, and structure largely determines functionality. Theability to understand proteins, from their initial structural conformation to their functional propertiesafter stabilization, are vital for bioengineering tasks such as drug design, disease identification, andtherapeutic treatment.Improving technologies for protein sequencing and structure determination have led to the rapidgrowth of various databases such as PDB [13], UniRef50 [108], BindDB [10], and many others, whichcollect structural and functional information of various sequences. Despite the growing knowledge ofexisting sequences and their properties, our understanding of the natural processes that drive themremain limited. The inter- and intra-molecular forces involved are highly complex, making traditionalstatistical and physical modelling approaches challenging. The possible orderings and combinationsof amino acids also form a massive sequence space [33], and existing databases are only limited to the space explored by natural evolution [46]. Important tasks such as de novo design however,which involves designing proteins rarely occurring in nature, require an intimate understanding of therelationship between sequence, structure, and function.Deep learning techniques have been increasingly applied to the field of bioinformatics in recent years.These techniques are characterized by their ability to learn relevant features automatically throughgradient descent using large datasets, and have been shown to consistently outperfrom traditionalmodelling techniques in different fields. The increasing availability of protein sequencing data hasmade protein bioinformatics a particularly suitable domain for deep learning. This is particularlyapparent in the protein structure prediction problem, which aims to determining the 3D structureof a protein when only given its sequence. In 2020, Deep Mind\\u2019s Alphafold2 model was ableto achieve structural prediction accuracy comparable to experimental validation methods in theCASP14 competition, arguably \\u0022solving\\u0022 the problem. Impressive progress has also been made inother problems such as protein functional prediction, protein-protein interaction (PPI), binding siteidentification, etc by similarly applying deep learning techniques.Protein design remains a challenging problem however since it involves by definition discoveringsequences or structures that may not occur naturally. Whereas tasks such as structural and functionalprediction are relatively well defined and accompanied by relevant datasets, protein design requiresdiscovering stable molecules subject to some functional objective. This also happens to be the mostrelevant for problems such as drug design and disease treatment and have the largest potential forsocial benefit.In this paper, we systematically review the progress that has been achieved from applying deeplearning methodologies to protein bioinformatics and how they have unlocked new possibilities forimprovements in protein design. We follow the common paradigm of broadly classifying problemsinto three main categories [23]: 1) structural prediction, 2) functional prediction, and 3) proteindesign, and start by first reviewing recent progress for categories 1) and 2), which are well definedproblems addressable with large labelled datasets. We then discuss the main challenges of 3), recentprogress from applying deep learning techniques, and how breakthroughs in 1) and 2) have also ledto improvements in design by treating it as the inverse of structural and functional prediction. Finally,we conclude by discussing potential future research directions in applying deep learning to proteindesign.",

        "full-text": "DNA methylation is the process of chemically modifying DNA by adding methyl groups to CpG sites, which providescells with an epigenetic code that dictates their function. The state of the methylation sites alter the expression ofgenes. Strikingly, the methylation pattern changes in aging. This observation led to the development of aging clocks- algorithms to estimate an individual\\u2019s chronological [1] - from methylation patterns. Analyzing these methylationchanges through advanced statistical or machine learning models makes achieving highly accurate age estimationspossible. This technique is paramount in aging research[2].However, modeling DNA methylation age prediction effectively is complex due to two intrinsic properties of CpGmethylation. Firstly, the correlation between CpG site methylation levels and age is not static but changes with age,which we call Epigenetic Correlation Drift (ECD). Specifically, DNA methylation levels change rapidly during earlydevelopment and adolescence, stabilize during adulthood, and may alter again in older ages [3, 4]. This nonlinearity[5]poses significant challenges for traditional age prediction models, which often assume a uniform rate of change acrossthe lifespan. Consequently, relying on a static overall linear correlation value can overlook CpG sites that are highlycorrelated with age in specific ranges, such as 40-50 years, but exhibit low correlation outside these ranges. DifferentCpG sites exhibit distinct methylation change patterns, called Heterogeneity Among CpGs (HAC). For example, a CpG site might have a high correlation with age during one age stage but a low correlation in the next, while other CpG sitesmaintain a high correlation in the subsequent stage.Moreover, modern technologies enable one to measure the methylation state of 450,000 or more CpG sites. Hence,selecting important CpG sites for modelling is one of the crucial steps. All related work typically employs linearregression along with Pearson and Spearman coefficients to select CpG sites[6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], operatingunder the assumption of a linear relationship or monotonicity. However, this approach faces significant drawbacksdue to a need for more consideration of the ECD. The correlation between CpG site methylation levels and age is notstatic but varies over time. This variability means that modelling based on this kind of CpG site selection may fail toaccurately capture the age-related methylation patterns across all age ranges. For instance, a CpG site may exhibit ahigh correlation with age in the 0-20 age range and a low correlation in the 20-30 age range. Consequently, using asingle linear correlation value or weight for the entire age range may overlook CpG sites highly correlated with ageonly within specific intervals, such as 40-50 years, but show low correlation outside these intervals.While machine learning and deep learning techniques have shown significant success in related works on biologicalage prediction[10, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18], the need for model interpretability has become increasingly important in thisdomain. The ability to explain model predictions is crucial for understanding the underlying aging mechanisms,especially in clinical settings where interpretability can guide informed decision-making. [19] introduces the ENABLAge framework, which combines gradient-boosted trees (GBM) with Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP), a type ofinterpretable machine learning technique. This approach not only achieves high predictive accuracy but also providesindividualized explanations for each prediction, offering deeper insights into the contributing factors of biological age.Despite its promise, the application of interpretable machine learning methods in this area remains limited, with thisstudy being one of the few that address the need for transparency in age prediction models.To address these limitations, we firstly propose a novel two-phase algorithm for DNA methylation age prediction thatexplicitly accounts for the nonlinear nature of methylation changes across different age phases. Our approach first usesFacebook AI Similarity Search (FAISS) to cluster methylation profiles into age groups based on their similarity[20].Rapid clustering can be done without dimensionality reduction due to the ability of FAISS to efficiently handle ultra-highdimensional data. The second phase involves training a specific model for each age group. Secondly, we select differentDNA CpG sites for different age groups for training the Explainable Boosting Machine (EBM)[21, 22, 23] model,which not only improves the precision of age predictions but also enhances the interpretability and scalability of themodels. By focusing on specific age groups, we reduce the variability within each group, leading to more reliable andinterpretable results.",

It covers approximately 3Mb and includes the six classical transplantationloci: class I (HLA-A, -B, and -C) and class II (HLA-DP, -DQ, -DR) [1].HLA molecules are cell surface proteins that are germline encoded and remain unchangedfor the lifetime of the holder. They act with other cellular components constantly to monitorendogenous and exogenous proteins of the internal environment of the body. Peptides derivedfrom these proteins are mounted in peptide-HLA complexes that are presented to T-cells. T_x0002_cells recognising endogenous peptides are removed during f\\u0153tal development, when foreignproteins are absent. This step limits the T-cell repertoire post-partum to a subset that recog_x0002_nizes only foreign peptides bound to HLA molecules, thereby detecting pathogen invasion.The structural feature of HLA molecules that underpins their function is a pocket of ap_x0002_proximately 60 amino-acids derived from exons 2 and 3 for class I alleles, and exon 2 forclass II. These define a peptide-binding site (PBS). HLA class I and II loci show extensivepolymorphism in these pockets. HLA class I and II loci also form numerous haplotypes thatdisplay variation through allelic permutation.The scale of the polymorphism is large. An analysis of Caucasian five-locus HLA haplotypefrequencies held by the US National Donor Marrow Program (NMDP) Registry indicates85,000 haplotypes in a population of \\u22486.7 million individuals [2]. Haplotype frequenciesrange over nearly six orders of magnitude even in this limited sample. Allele and haplotypediscovery is far from complete. A cardinal feature of the HLA transplantation is balancingselection, the apparently stable existence of haplotypes and alleles at intermediate frequencies.A scan of the human genome for other regions under balancing selection found no other region,other than the ABO system, that could not be explained by neutrality [3] (although see [4] fora more recent assessment).Observations requiring explanation include:\\u2022 allele and haplotype frequency distributions are characterised by heavy tails [2]\\u2022 linkage disequilibrium is positive (D\\u2032ij > 0) in high-frequency haplotypes and negative(D\\u2032ij < 0) among rare haplotypes [5]\\u2022 the Ewens-Watterson test for homozygosity shows excess homozygosity for common5-locus haplotypes [5]\\u2022 the distribution of allelic frequencies does not conform to neutral expectations [6]\\u2022 the rate of non-synonymous nucleotide substitution significantly exceeds the rate ofsynonymous substitution (dN /ds > 1) in codons in the peptide-binding-region (PBR)[6]\\u2022 maintainenance of alleles over long periods of time (Neanderthal/Denisovan ancestryin HLA class I alleles that has survived since the last introgression (approximately 45-50,000 years ago) [7, 8] and trans-species polymorphism in HLA class II loci that hassurvived since the last common ancestor (6-8 mya) [9, 10, 11])homogenization of introns relative to exons over evolutionary time [6]\\u2022 HLA class I supertypes [12, 13]\\u2022 frozen HLA haplotype blocks [14]\\u2022 recent selection on MHC standing variation as shown by inheritance by descent (IBD)[15, 11]\\u2022 high values of the f\\u2217adjHLA metric [16]A list of some of the explanations for HLA polymorphism proposed over the past 50 yearsor so includes negative frequency-dependent selection (NFDS), heterozygote advantage (HA),overdominance, rare allele advantage, divergent allele advantage, pleiotropy, and segregationdistortion balanced by negative selection. Some of these proposed explanations overlap withothers or are broadly synonymous. There is no consensus theory of HLA polymorphism butthe explanations of longest standing are NFDS, HA, and environmental changes over timeand/or space [17], and Box 3 in [18].There is an alternative and unexplored explanation for HLA polymorphism that rests ondensity-dependent regulation of individual species of HLA haplotypes by diseases.The background to the idea is the stable existence of species diversity among Linneanspecies under the actions of natural selection/competitive exclusion on the one hand andlimiting similarity/character displacement on the other. The theoretical basis for haplotypediversity at steady-state can be be covered by the Lotka-Volterra competion equations, anddensity-dependent regulation by disease has its origins in the Verhulst logistic equations andthe equations for disease transmission of Anderson and May [19].This paper is divided into four sections: (i) this Introduction; (ii) an outline of relevant theo_x0002_retical considerations; (iii) an analysis of the Caucasian HLA haplotype dataset available fromthe US National Marrow Donor Program (NMDP) together with some running commentary;(iv) a discussion of the principal findings.",

        "full-text": "There is an ever growing symbiosis between research in biological and artificial intelligence. Artificial intelligence research produces algorithms that achieve human or superhuman performance, which are currently the best predictive models of neural responses to sensory stimulation (Cichy and Kaiser, 2019; Doerig et al., 2023; Kietzmann et al., 2019; Richards et al., 2022, 2019a; Saxe et al., 2021; Yamins and DiCarlo, 2016). The creation of increasingly powerful data-hungry models has pushed biological intelligence scientists to collect large-scale neural datasets that intensively sample single subjects (Allen et al., 2022; Gifford et al., 2022; Hebart et al., 2023; Kupers et al., 2024; Lahner et al., 2024; Naselaris et al., 2021). These large datasets facilitate the discovery and modeling of new neural mechanisms that in turn inspire the development of better artificial intelligence algorithms (Hassabis et al., 2017; Sinz et al., 2019; Ullman, 2019; Yang et al., 2022; Zador et al., 2023), and provide inductive biases to increase the robustness of artificial agents (Dapello et al., 2022; Guo et al., 2024; Li et al., 2019; Safarani et al., 2021; Shao et al., 2024; Toneva and Wehbe, 2019). Neuroscience challenges and benchmarks catalyze the symbiosis between biological and artificial intelligences. They offer interactive platforms for scientists from different disciplines to cooperate and compete in building the best models of intelligence (Cichy et al., 2019a, 2019b, 2021; Gifford et al., 2023; Schrimpf et al., 2018, 2020; Turishcheva et al., 2023; Willeke et al., 2022a). Here, we introduce the 2025 edition of the Algonauts Project challenge, titled \\u201cHow the Human Brain Makes Sense of Multimodal Movies\\u201d. This edition is based on data from the Courtois Project on Neuronal Modelling (CNeuroMod, https://www.cneuromod.ca/), which has acquired the largest human dataset of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) neural responses to naturalistic multimodal stimulation to date (Boyle et al., 2023). The current challenge shares the goal of the three previous Algonauts Project challenges, which is to predict human brain responses through computational models (Cichy et al., 2021, 2019a; Gifford et al., 2023). Yet, it goes beyond the previous challenges in three important ways. First, to foster the development of computational models that better capture neural responses to real-life scenarios, the 2025 challenge uses multimodal naturalistic stimuli, which go beyond the unimodal images and short videos used in previous challenges (Figure 1a). Second, it provides an unprecedented amount of data on which to train and test computational models of the brain, with almost 80 hours of neural recordings per subject (Figure 1b). Third, to promote more robust models of intelligence, the 2025 challenge provides both in_x0002_distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) tests of model performance, and the winning models will be selected solely based on their OOD performance (Figure 1c). Our vision for the Algonauts Project 2025 challenge is to advance our understanding of the brain through more accurate and robust modeling of neural responses to multimodal naturalistic stimulation, and to improve the engineering of artificial models through biological intelligence constraints. By achieving both aims, we hope to strengthen the symbiosis between biological and artificial intelligence",

Among these models, two-dimensional (2D) monolayers of iPSC derived human hepatocytes and bioengineered micro-patterned co-cultures of primary hepatocytes and fibroblasts have exhibited some morphological and functional features of in vivo liver tissue7, 8. However, the limitations of monolayer cultures in predicting liver-specific responses are widely recognized, despite their frequent use throughout the pharmaceutical industry9-13. For example, primary hepatocytes cultured in 2D monolayers tend to de-differentiate and rapidly lose liver specific functions14-16. To overcome the deficits of 2D approaches, numerous 3D culture systemshave been developed; it is believed that the formation of cell\\u2013cell, and cell\\u2013matrix interactions in 3D are better at maintaining cell activity and function than in 2D cultures2, 17. Three-dimensional (3D) approaches include spheroid culture of primary hepatocytes18, 3D bioprinted liver tissue in trans-wells19, and 3D printed scaffolds seeded with hepatocytes10, 20. These 3D systems are usually benchmarked by functional characteristics of human liver in vivo, such as albumin and urea production and ADME gene expression profiles21.One way to improve the functional performance of tissue models is to provide perfusion; liver tissue models cultured in microfluidic perfusion chambers exhibit higher viability, oxygen saturation, and synthesis rates of albumin and urea than their static counterparts22. To simulate physiological fluid and solute transport, culture media has been driven through 3D populations of hepatocytes sandwiched between collagen gels23. Toward the goal of making large-scale engineered tissue constructs, advanced methods for creating vasculature have been developed24, 25.While developing a diversity of advanced engineering approaches has helped the field move closer to the goal of producing functional tissue models, the complexity of both the manufacturing methods and the fluidic systems prevent their broad adoption in practice and create scale-up challenges in industrial applications. These challenges are not encountered with simpler approaches to manufacturing tissue models, like spheroid culture, but such simple approachesproduce tissue models that lack critical functions and exhibit high variability, preventing accurate Critical Quality Attributes (CQA) quantification of the final products1. Overall, there remains a serious need in the pharmaceutical industry for a functional liver tissue model having minimal barriers to adoption; the functional tissue must be manufactured reproducibly and at relatively high throughput and maintained without complex perfusion equipment.Here, we describe a method for rapidly and precisely manufacturing functional human liver tissue models that can be cultured and assayed for more than 21 days without complex fluidic systems or specialized apparatus. To create millimeter-scale constructs that do not need to be perfused, we manufacture disc-shaped structures (discoids) that are 200 \\u00b5m thick. The tissues are 3D bioprinted directly into a medium made by packing soft granular-scale spheres (microgels) together, swollen in cell growth media. The biofabricated method is precise and accurate, with less than 5% variability and error in the effective diameter of printed discoid tissues. The biofabricated liver tissue discoids exhibit stable albumin and urea synthesis at target levels, ADME gene expression profiles that mimic the human liver, and the ability to metabolize test compounds. We fabricate the discoids directly into the wells of 96-well plates at a rate exceeding one tissue per minute. This approach is compatible with standard biolaboratory equipment and instrumentation, while also able to be scaled-up and integrated with product quality assessments in future commercial manufacturing efforts.",

Further emphasis was laid on the neural network\\u2019sability to account for volatility clustering and its practicality for a real-world implementation. Threedifferent network architecture were tested: a 2-component mixture density network, a regularized versionof the 2-component model as proposed by Arimond et al.

Indeed, democracies around the world are facing early stages of a system-transforming war by a newly formed \\u201caxis of dictatorships.\\u201d Russia and China are setting a new global agenda, while Iran and North Korea work to dismantle what\\u2019s left of their regional power balances. The three decades of the post-Cold War peace period in Europe has ended abruptly with the Russia\\u2019s full-scale war against Ukraine. Not just this one military\\u2019s aggression challenge, but through multiple, security-political-economic-environmental challenges Europe is increasingly facing multi-dimensional, complex and cross-border threats and attacks. Security threats coming from state and non-state actors abroad in the form of hybrid warfare blur the lines between conventional and unconventional forms of conflict, the lines between civilian and military, state and non-state, peace and war are increasingly blurred. The nature of hybrid warfare on Europe is changing. In addition to cyber-attacks, increasingly also physical and brazen attacks, as with sabotage, electronic signals jamming, drone incursions, parcel bombs on airplanes, damage ofcritical energy infrastructure such as underwater cables, and assassinations using chemical/biological agents.The changing geopolitical and security landscape in the world requires strategic adjustments in security and defence policies. As noted by Niinist\\u00f6 (2024), Europe must adjust for an era of a fierce geopolitical competition and strategic confrontation, where the rules-based international order is under a constant attack. Indeed, the new informal alliance of China, Russia, Iran and North Korea (CRINK) accelerates to consolidate and is preparing for a long-term confrontation. The collective West however \\u2013 although declaring itself united \\u2013 remains fractured politically, militarily and economically. Democratic allies are often divided when it comes to their economic interests and they lack a shared threat assessment. During the Cold War, NATO\\u0027s European members spent an average of about 3.8 percent of GDP on defence. For comparison, the EU\\u2019s defence expenditure was 1.6% in 2023 (EDA 2024). Many political and strategic leaders in Europe are still struggling with accepting that the good old days of post-Cold War peace in Europe have passed. In reality, the threats to our freedom and security are just as big as during the Cold War \\u2013 if not bigger (Rutte 2024). Peace and prosperity will have to be defended.In the context of the evolving security environment, we study how prepared and ready are European allies to defend their peace and prosperity in a protracted conflict and war. We undertake a scenario analysis of the European defence readiness by stress-testing the defence industrial mobilisation, force mobility, and sustained whole-of-society resilience in a contested environment in order to identify fields of action and thus improve how Europe identifies vulnerabilities, evaluates its preparedness and enhances its readiness. The scenario analysis consists of two subsequent steps. First, by applying a general equilibrium multi-sector approach of Antras and Chor (2022) to the global economy, we simulate the Cold War 2.0 scenario as one possible future boundary condition.By looking through the lens of a general equilibrium model featuring global value chains, we consider the full pattern of intermediate input purchases and final-use defence expenditures as measured in data. In a second step, the potential impacts of the simulated systemic shocks on the European defence readiness are evaluated. To assess the defence industrial mobilisation in Europe, we calculate the ability of existing and surge production capabilities to replace weapon inventories destroyed in the event of a prolonged conflict. To study the force mobility, we compute the movement time represented by the effective average speed of force element movement, i.e. the time it takes the force elements to reach its destination. The whole-of-society sustained resilience is assessed via the Enhanced Analytic Resilience Index under changed future boundary conditions.",

As a result, analyzing the cryptocurrencymarket, designing strategies, and building portfolios become a hugeundertaking and impose a heavy workload on financial experts,\\u2217Corresponding author.making professional services either scarce or expensive [6]. Toaddress these challenges, many researchers have explored the useof deep learning techniques [16, 24] for cryptocurrency investment.However, the \\u201cblack-box\\u201d nature of most deep learning modelsraises concerns about trust and explainability, making investorshesitant to rely on these techniques when investing their capital [4,5, 26].The introduction of large language models (LLMs) has revolutionized the financial field, offering promising solutions for cryptocurrency investment. Numerous studies have demonstrated thestrong capability of LLMs to understand and learn from multi-modaldata [40] such as text [28, 39] and images [41], which makes themwell-suited for learning professional cryptocurrency investmentknowledge and analyzing the market from data in different modalities. On the other hand, LLMs has excellent natural language generation capability [29, 36], which enables them to generate explainablecryptocurrency investment decisions. However, the performance ofsingle LLMs in asset prediction is limited due to the comprehensivenature and complex reasoning requirement of this task [25, 38].The weakness is even more pronounced in cryptocurrency investment, where LLMs have less domain-specific knowledge in theirtraining corpora. To address this type of challenge, researchershave developed methodologies that decompose complex tasks intosubtasks [33, 37]. This method uses the collaboration between multiple LLM-based agents to derive final comprehensive solutions,with each agent focusing on a specific aspect of the overall task.Inspired by human cognitive processes, this method enhances reasoning capabilities and efficacy in solving comprehensive problems,offering new possibilities for agent-based investment solutions. Although some studies have explored the use of multi-agent models instock investment [11, 14], works that employ the multi-agent modelin cryptocurrency investment are few and are limited to Bitcoin,Ethereum, and Solana as well as data in single modality [27].To address the above-mentioned problems and fill in the gap,we propose an explainable, multi-modal, multi-agent framework,which utilizes multiple teams of agents that collaborate both withinand across teams to facilitate supervised learning and investmentdecisions across the top 30 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. Within this framework, complex investment tasks involving data from different modalities are decomposed into several subtasks, with each fine-tuned expert agent assigned responsibility fora specific subtask. Inspired by the communication methods usedin hedge funds, our unique intrateam and interteam collaborationmechanism ensures that the final investment decision integratesinformation from multiple modalities effectively.Our multi-agent framework consists of two modules: the expert training module and the multi-agent investment module. Theexpert training module employs agents from the data team andliterature team to fetch historical multi-modal data and relevantinvestment literature, respectively. Next, agents in the explanation team process the data and literature to generate high-qualityprompts by integrating multi-modal information and professionalinvestment knowledge. Finally, these prompts are used to fine-tuneexpert investment agents, each specializing in the analysis of datain a single modality. The multi-agent investment module utilizesthe data team to fetch real-time data and forward it to the marketteam and crypto team. The market team includes two expert agentswho analyze news and market factors to predict market trends anddetermine the cash-crypto allocation. Similarly, the crypto team hastwo expert agents who analyze crypto-specific factors and candlestick charts of individual cryptocurrencies to make crypto selectiondecisions. Finally, the trading team interacts with cryptocurrencyexchange APIs to execute the final portfolio strategy. The intrateamcollaboration mechanism combines the confidence scores of agentswithin the same group to produce an ensemble prediction. Theinterteam collaboration mechanism allows agents in the cryptoteam to share memory with the market team regarding marketinformation, enabling more robust crypto selection decisions basedon comprehensive information.To demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework, we use datafrom June 2023 to September 2024 to validate its ability to outperform single-agent models, both with and without fine-tuning,in terms of classification accuracy and asset pricing performance.Additionally, we show that our framework surpasses market benchmarks in portfolio performance.",

Unlike the physical world governed bythe eternal laws of the nature, \\u201claws\\u201d of finance permanently vary due to variousfactors including even a theoretical development which may strongly influence thebehavior of economic agents. There is a non-stop competition of models describingthe dynamics of basic securities as well as ideas how to price the derivative securities.It may happen that specific features that was considered yesterday as drawbacks turnto be advantages today as reflecting new reality. In their everyday practice, financialengineers (\\u201cquants\\u201d) are asked questions what is the price of such and such optioncontract. Mathematics provided a plethora of models and general pricing recommendations. The simplest one is the classic \\u201dpricing by replication\\u201d paradigm suggested byBlack and Scholes for a model where price of the basic securities are given by geometric Brownian motions and the number of \\u201csources of randomness\\u201d is equal tothe number of risky assets. In this case the \\u201cmarket\\u201d, or better to say, market modelis complete, the equivalent martingale measure is unique, and every European-typecontingent claim can be replicated by the terminal value a portfolio. Unfortunately,in the majority of cases statistical tests reject the hypothesis that the logarithms ofprice increments are Gaussian random variables. This fact leads to a search for bettermodels of the price dynamics.Amongst models of price evolution of basic securities, nowadays the so-calledstochastic volatility models again become very popular. One of them, sometimes referred to as the exponential Ornstein\\u2013Uhlenbeck model, see Mejia Vega [6], is considered in the present note.The general recommendation how to provide an arbitrage-free price of an optionconsists in computation of its mean with respect to an equivalent martingale measure(EMM). The delicate issue here is with respect to which one. Various solutions aresuggested. Some experts recommend to enlarge the framework by considering moretraded securities (for example, traded \\u201cvanilla\\u201d options) to get a complete market witha single equivalent martingale measure. In other words, there is a believe that marketfollows the \\u201dpricing by replication\\u201d rule.Other experts defend the idea that financial markets choose a relevant equivalentmartingale measure using a certain variational principle. A reasonable choice is theentropy minimization one. We compute such a martingale measure for the consideredmodel and use this occasion to present a brief, hopefully, comprehensive piece ofthe beautiful theory of entropy minimal martingale measures usually suffered fromtechnical details and generalizations. In our presentation we are based mainly onpapers by Hobson [2], Frittelli [1], and Kabanov and Stricker, [5]. In our numericalexperiments we observe using real data (but artificially chosen coefficients) that sucha pricing rule gives rather good approximation of the observed option prices.",

Themodern science of networks seeks to unravel both thestructural and functional aspects of these systems, wherenodes represent fundamental units and edges denote theirinteractions [15].One of the most critical features of many networks istheir community structure\\u2014clusters of nodes that aremore densely connected internally than with the rest ofthe network. Community detection, also referred to asgraph partitioning, is a central challenge in network science, aiming to divide the network into groups whileminimizing inter-group connections [16]. This problemis classified as NP-hard, making it increasingly difficultto solve as network size grows [17].Among the various techniques for community detection, modularity maximization is one of the most widelyused. Modularity is a scalar function that measures thequality of a network division by comparing the density oflinks within communities against a random baseline [18].A higher modularity score indicates a more pronouncedcommunity structure. However, maximizing modularity becomes computationally infeasible for large networks,necessitating the use of approximate methods.Several heuristic approaches have been developed toaddress modularity maximization, including greedy algorithms [19, 20], simulated annealing [21, 22], extremaloptimization [23], genetic algorithms [24], and the widelyused Louvain method [25]. Despite these advances, nosingle algorithm performs optimally across all networktypes due to variations in network structures and purposes [26]. The vast search space further complicatessolving community detection problems with conventionalmethods [27].To overcome these challenges, Ising computing hasemerged as a promising approach for solving hard combinatorial optimization problems, including communitydetection [27]. The Ising model is particularly notablebecause any NP-hard problem can be reformulated asan Ising model with polynomial overhead. Scalable Isingcomputing frameworks could revolutionize optimizationin various domains. Among the leading implementationsof Ising computing are hardware solutions like D-Wave\\u2019sQuantum Annealer (QA) and Fujitsu\\u2019s Digital Annealer(DA), both of which have demonstrated high efficiency intackling combinatorial optimization tasks. Recent studies have applied these systems to community detectionwith encouraging results [28\\u201332].In addition to hardware solutions, Ising computingcan also be implemented algorithmically on conventionalhardware. One such approach is the Simulated Bifurcation (SB) algorithm, a GPU-accelerated quantuminspired method designed for solving large-scale combinatorial problems efficiently [33]. This study explores theapplication of SB to community detection, benchmarking its performance on two networks: Zachary\\u2019s Karate Club,a well-known social network, and the IEEE 33-Bus system, a benchmark in power distribution networks.

The need forannual estimates to track progress of the initiative led to the development of standard indicators,approaches, and methodologies. For countries, having annual estimates of FP indicators wasa priority to better gauge progress towards their own objectives. After the FP2020 initiativeconcluded, the FP2030 initiative was started with a continued focus on measurement and settingof country-specific commitments.Track20, implemented by Avenir Health and funded by the Gates Foundation, is a globalfamily planning project aimed at improving global and country level use of data. The project\\u2019saims include the development and introduction of innovative and user-friendly methodologies,tools, and approaches that build capacity and broaden who can effectively engage with family planning data. Track20 has provided the annual estimates used for FP2020 related measurements and continues to assess progress for FP2030 and the Ouagadougou Partnership (focused on FP in countries in western Africa, see https://www.speakupafrica.org/program/speak-up-africa-website-blurb-for-the-ouagadougou-partnership-op/). This is donethrough a bottom-up reporting process led by government monitoring and evaluation (M&E)officers, effectively linking country and global FP data.The Family Planning Estimation Tool (FPET) is used by Track20 in low- and middleincome countries to produce estimates and short-term forecasts of FP indicators, such as moderncontraceptive use and unmet need for contraceptives. Estimates are obtained via a Bayesianstatistical model that is fitted to country-specific data from surveys and service statistics data.The model is a country-specific implementation of a global model for FP estimation, referredto as the global Family Planning Estimation Model (Alkema et al. [2013], Cahill et al. [2018],Kantorov\\u00b4a et al. [2020]). The country-specific implementation was produced to introduce andfacilitate in-country usage by the Track20 project. FPET has evolved over the last decade basedon usage in the Track20 project and other user inputs and requests. Recent statistical modelingupdates include relaxation of strong parametric assumptions made regarding contraceptive usetransitions (Susmann and Alkema [2023]), updated use of survey data to improve estimation inthe presence of data outliers (Alkema et al.

        "full-text": "Semi-supervised learning is a machine learning technique that leverages both labeled and unlabeleddata during training, making it especially useful when data labeling is costly, time-intensive or facing ethical issues. Such datasets, often termed \\u201dmeasurement-constrained datasets\\u201d, are commonin many fields. For example, the critical temperature of superconductors, which depends on theirchemical composition, is a key property but difficult to predict due to the lack of an accuratescientific model. A data-driven approach is needed to develop materials with higher critical temperatures. Since synthesizing materials is costly and time-consuming, only a few compounds can be tested (Hamidieh, 2018). Another example is galaxy classification. This is essential in astronomy but challenging due to the rapid growth of astronomical datasets from advanced telescopes.Since human visual classification is time-consuming and costly, it\\u2019s crucial to select a representativesample of galaxies for accurate human classification (Banerji et al., 2010).Many studies on semi-supervised learning prioritize algorithm development, often overlooking statistical estimation, which poses challenges for model interpretability (Chapelle et al., 2010). Whenconsidering statistical estimation, methodologies typically rely on nonparametric estimation techniques that can be computationally intensive for large-scale datasets (Tony Cai and Guo, 2020;Azriel et al., 2022; Deng et al., 2023). A widely used approach to mitigate these challenges is sampling. Rather than simply selecting data at random for labeling, this approach involves selectinga subset of data and obtaining the outcome for it based on a sampling distribution. Samplingmethods have been extensively studied, with significant developments in leverage sampling (Maet al., 2015; Wang et al., 2019; Ma et al., 2022), A-optimal sampling (Wang et al., 2018; Ting andBrochu, 2018; Ai et al., 2021), and optimal experimental design (Wang et al., 2017; Meng et al.,2021). However, most of these approaches assume that response data is accessible across the fulldataset, which restricts their applicability in settings where response measurements are constrainedor costly to obtain. Zhang et al. (2021) address this limitation by proposing a sampling method thatprovides statistically consistent and asymptotically normal estimators, with minimal performancecompromise relative to fully labeled methods (Wang et al., 2018; Ma et al., 2015).Another attempt to deal with the scarcity of the response variable in a measurement constraineddataset is to create a surrogate variable by various means including machine learning methods andMonte Carlo simulations. One of the important applications with this technique applied is theelectronic health records (EHR). EHR are a valuable resource for health research, often used toidentify novel disease risk factors. Due to a lack of the binary phenotypes of patients, researchersuse phenotyping algorithms to make predictions for this phenotype as substitutions to the trueconditions of patients. Even though many papers (Oh et al., 2021; Yang et al., 2023; Weinsteinet al., 2023) improve the performance of the phenotyping methods, they may still misclassify patient conditions. This misclassification can introduce systematic bias, increase type I errors, andreduce statistical power in studies. Tong et al. (2020) proposed a method that incorporates bothtrue phenotype data from a validation set and phenotyping predictions across the dataset, demonstrating that this approach yields a consistent estimator with lower variance compared to methodslimited to the validation-set phenotype data.Building on the concepts of sampling and surrogate variable utilization as introduced by Tonget al. (2020), we propose an enhanced sampling method that preserves key statistical properties,such as statistical consistency and asymptotic normality, seen in Zhang et al. (2021), while offeringsignificant improvements. The primary advantage of our method lies in its integration of surrogatevariable information, resulting in theoretically lower variance. This integration allows our approachto leverage contextual insights from unlabeled data, refining estimations in measurement-limited scenarios. By incorporating surrogate variables in the sampling method, our method yields moreaccurate estimations and enhances the performance in real-world applications. Numerical studiesdemonstrate that our method achieves lower empirical mean squared error, aligning well with theoretical expectations, and exhibits superior algorithmic stability compared to Zhang et al. (2021),whose estimators may diverge under certain data distributions. The consistent stability of ourmethod across diverse datasets and sampling scenarios highlights its applicability and robustness,addressing typical scalability issues associated with semi-supervised learning and supporting its usein a range of practical contexts.",

Starting with understanding whatquantum advantages are achievable in machine learning to how to implement, a varietyof studies has currently been conducted\\u2014hence, a subfield, so-called the quantummachine learning (QML), has emerged [1, 2]. One of the celebrated results in QMLis the achievement of an exponential computing speedup in data classification by usinguseful quantum linear algebra kernels [3]. This result has been generalized other machinelearning tasks requiring the linear optimization, such as linear regression [4, 5], principalcomponent analysis [6], etc. Such a generalized method for QML includes the strongtheoretical proofs of the quantum computational learning speedup\\u2021.Meanwhile, the field of QML has shifted its focus to studying the propertiesof data described in Hilbet-space; in other words, (so-called) the quantum data hasbecome important\\u00a7. Such a development trend is unsurprising since the machinelearning is essentially a data-driven process. One significant recent achievement is thediscovery that some eligible data representations in the quantum Hilbert-space, suchas quantum feature map, offer the quantum computational advantages [10, 11]. Sincethen, subsequent researches have continued to explore the various QML advantages interms of the quantum data-encoding [12, 13]: in short,{(x, c(x))} \\u2192 |\\u03a8(x, c(x))\\u27e9, (1)where x \\u2208 X denotes a user-recognizable classical data and c \\u2208 C is a target map.From another perspective, there have been several studies exploring the propertiesof the security in QML. Here, the security in the learning refers to the safeguardingof a client\\u2019s confidential data and learning outcomes from any external intruders. Thisscenario, i.e., in which more than one learning party is involved, is natural in machinelearning and becomes a useful interface between the security, computation, and machinelearning. In a few early studies and subsequent works, it has been shown that a clientcan learn a task securely by leveraging a server at a distant place [14, 15]. After that,the efforts are underway to contextualize the ideas devised for specific applications intogeneral principles. For example, the security-related QML algorithms, such as anomalydetection, have been studied in a data-networked setting [16, 17, 18]. In Ref. [19], asecurity condition is defined by the theoretical bounds of the learning sample complexity.Recently, a secure quantum pattern encoding has been studied in the framework of thecontinuous-variable system [20]. However, there remains a lack of studies that leveragethe power of the quantum-encoded data in terms of the machine learning security. Building upon previous research and in the line with Ref. [19], we investigate thetheoretical conditions under which an authorized learner exclusively achieves superiorlearning outcomes. To this end, we introduce the concept of learning probabilitywithin the computational learning framework known as probably-approximately-correct(PAC) learning [21, 22]. This model setting enables us to quantitatively measurethe performance of authorized and eavesdropping learners. By utilizing a classical quantum hybrid data encoding [23, 24], dubbed here as quantum label encoding, wepresent a theorem proving that a certain level of learning outcome quality is guaranteedexclusively for the authorized learner and not for the eavesdropping learners. Our studyextends beyond theoretical proof to a practical application, the image classificationusing convolutional neural network (CNN). This demonstration confirms that a specificquality of learning outcomes, attainable only by the authorized learner, can indeed beobserved in practical tasks. We expect our study to offer a framework for analyzing thelearning performances in quantum secure learning scenarios, with a focus solely on theproperties of the quantum training data.",

Since then, https://www.datascienceprograms.org/now tracks more than 1,000 different data science programs in the United States. The National Center forEducation Statistics reported a recent jump in data science bachelor\\u2019s degrees awarded, from 84 in 2020 to897 in 2022, almost 11 times as many degrees in two years!(Pierson, 2023) The programs are often grownout of mathematics or statistics departments (sometimes computer science departments) by individualswho were trained in the mathematical sciences. Additionally, there has been rapid growth in data scienceprograms across the K-12 curriculum (National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, 2023;Israel-Fishelson et al., 2024; Data Science 4 Everyone, 2024).All of which makes it feel like data science is just math or statistics (or computer science). But, on theother hand, that data science really isn\\u2019t just math or statistics (or computer science). As individuals whohave been trained in the mathematical sciences (us), it is important to understand the ways that a datascience curriculum connects directly to a mathematics curriculum and the ways in which data science isquite distinct from curricula in the mathematical sciences. Indeed, the training that students receive withinthe mathematical sciences is often aligned with the building blocks of data science, and connecting themathematical + data science ideas can benefit students across the mathematical and data sciences. Insteadof thinking of data science as just a set of tools or skills, we believe that data science students should be taughtfoundational ideas that underlie working with data; after all, the tools will probably be completely differenttwenty years from now but the important ideas will remain the same. This paper describes pedagogy familiarto mathematicians and statisticians which can be emphasized to support a strong data science foundation(and also benefit all students in the mathematical sciences, along the way).In 2018, The National Academies put out a report Data Science for Undergraduates: Opportunitiesand Options (National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, 2018) outlining a vision for theemerging discipline of data science at the undergraduate level. A key goal of the report was to definewhat would give all students the ability to make good judgments, use tools responsibly and effectively, andultimately make good decisions using data. The report defines the collection of abilities as \\u201cdata acumen.\\u201dFigure 1 summarizes the components of data acumen(National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, andMedicine, 2018).

        "full-text": "Data residing in curved spaces have recently received growing attention in numerous fields ofScience and Engineering. To model their underlying curved geometry, it is natural to model the spacein which they reside with known manifold geometries for example, (i) the Stiefel manifold, Vr(N),commonly used to model the space of directional data in fields of computer vision and medical imageanalysis [10, 64], dynamic system [7] and rigid body motion [36, 50, 57], (ii) Grassmann manifoldGr(N) in signal processing [12, 46, 60], shape analysis [23, 5, 68] and image processing [13, 14, 59],(iii) covariance matrices are modeled as points on the manifold of symmetric positive definite (SPD)matrices P(N) in diffusion magnetic resonance imaging [4, 18, 65, 31] and brain computer interfaces[9, 67].However, due to the lack of vector space structure, significant complications arise in the formulation and application of statistical methods to such curved spaces. e.g., the data points lying onmanifolds can not be simply summed up, thus the notion of the classical arithmetic mean is notmeaningful in general. Among all the challenges, the most significant one is the issue of normalization constant associated with probability distributions defined on the manifold-valued (M-valued) random variables, which arises in distributional comparison, parametric estimation and numerouspractical applications. Even the simplest distribution on the simplest curved manifold, e.g., the vonMises Fisher distribution p(x) \\u221d exp(\\u00b5\\u22a4x) on a sphere Sd\\u22121, has a normalization constant that isintractable. Furthermore, the KL-divergence KL(p, q) := Ep[log pq], which is the most commonly used loss function in parameter estimation, distributional comparison and neural network training,highly relies on the computation of normalization constant of p and q.In practice, approximating these constants and their derivative with respect to the parametersof the distribution requires the use of numerical methods such as the gradient descent and/or itsvariants, which has been resorted to by many researchers in statistics, machine learning and roboticsliterature [21, 22, 29, 30] but at the expense of a high computation cost. It would of course be moredesirable to fully avoid computing this intractable constant and simultaneously achieve high accuracyin parameter estimation. In fact, this will be the main objective of this paper.Kernel Stein Discrepancy (KSD), a normalization free loss function was first introduced by Liuet al. [37] as a measure of goodness of fit and for model evaluation. KSD measures the differencebetween distributions by using a combination of the so called Stein\\u2019s method and the well establishedreproducing kernels Hilbert space (RKHS) theory. KSD has since been extensively researched on,including various aspects within a general framework [35, 43, 44, 49], characterization of its scope[24, 25, 54], exploration of its asymptotic properties relating to minimization [2, 48], its diverseapplications [11, 37, 41], and generalizations to manifolds [3, 53, 66].",

Six weeks later the family moved to Munich, where he later on began his schooling at the Luitpold Gymnasium. Later, they moved to Italy and Albert continued his education at Aarau, Switzerland and in 1896 he entered the Swiss Federal Polytechnic School in Zurich to be trained as a teacher in physics and mathematics. In 1901, the year he gained his diploma, he acquired Swiss citizenship and, as he was unable to find a teaching post, he accepted a position as technical assistant in the Swiss Patent Office. In 1905 he obtained his doctor\\u2019s degree.During his stay at the Patent Office, and in his spare time, he produced much of his remarkable work and in 1908 he was appointed Privatdozent in Berne. In 1909 he became Professor Extraordinary at Zurich, in 1911 Professor of Theoretical Physics at Prague, returning to Zurich in the following year to fill a similar post. In 1914 he was appointed Director of the Kaiser Wilhelm Physical Institute and Professor in the University of Berlin. He became a German citizen in 1914 and remained in Berlin until 1933 when he renounced his citizenship for political reasons and emigrated to America to take the position of Professor of Theoretical Physics at Princeton*. He became a United States citizen in 1940 and retired from his post in 1945.After World War II, Einstein was a leading figure in the World Government Movement, he was offered the Presidency of the State of Israel, which he declined, and he collaborated with Dr. Chaim Weizmann in establishing the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.Einstein always appeared to have a clear view of the problems of physics and the determination to solve them. He had a strategy of his own and was able to visualize the main stages on the way to his goal. He regarded his major achievements as mere stepping-stones for the next advance.At the start of his scientific work, Einstein realized the inadequacies of Newtonian mechanics and his special theory of relativity stemmed from an attempt to reconcile the laws of mechanics with the laws of the electromagnetic field. He dealt with classical problems of statistical mechanics and problems in which they were merged with quantum theory: this led to an explanation of the Brownian movement of molecules. He investigated the thermal properties of light with a low radiation density and his observations laid the foundation of the photon theory of light.In his early days in Berlin, Einstein postulated that the correct interpretation of the special theory of relativity must also furnish a theory of gravitation and in 1916 he published his paper on the general theory of relativity. During this time he also contributed to the problems of the theory of radiation and statistical mechanics.In the 1920s, Einstein embarked on the construction of unified field theories, although he continued to work on the probabilistic interpretation of quantum theory, and he persevered with this work in America. He contributed to statistical mechanics by his development of the quantum theory of a monatomic gas and he has also accomplished valuable work in connection with atomic transition probabilities and relativistic cosmology.After his retirement he continued to work towards the unification of the basic concepts of physics, taking the opposite approach, geometrisation, to the majority of physicists.Einstein\\u2019s researches are, of course, well chronicled and his more important works include Special Theory of Relativity (1905), Relativity (English translations, 1920 and 1950), General Theory of Relativity (1916), Investigations on Theory of Brownian Movement (1926), and The Evolution of Physics (1938). Among his non-scientific works, About Zionism (1930), Why War? (1933), My Philosophy (1934), and Out of My Later Years (1950) are perhaps the most important.Albert Einstein received honorary doctorate degrees in science, medicine and philosophy from many European and American universities. During the 1920\\u2019s he lectured in Europe, America and the Far East, and he was awarded Fellowships or Memberships of all the leading scientific academies throughout the world. He gained numerous awards in recognition of his work, including the Copley Medal of the Royal Society of London in 1925, and the Franklin Medal of the Franklin Institute in 1935.Einstein\\u2019s gifts inevitably resulted in his dwelling much in intellectual solitude and, for relaxation, music played an important part in his life. He married Mileva Maric in 1903 and they had a daughter and two sons; their marriage was dissolved in 1919 and in the same year he married his cousin, Elsa L\\u00f6wenthal, who died in 1936. He died on April 18, 1955 at Princeton, New Jersey.",

She received a general education in local schools and some scientific training from her father. She became involved in a students\\u2019 revolutionary organization and found it prudent to leave Warsaw, then in the part of Poland dominated by Russia, for Cracow, which at that time was under Austrian rule. In 1891, she went to Paris to continue her studies at the Sorbonne where she obtained Licenciateships in Physics and the Mathematical Sciences. She met Pierre Curie, Professor in the School of Physics in 1894 and in the following year they were married. She succeeded her husband as Head of the Physics Laboratory at the Sorbonne, gained her Doctor of Science degree in 1903, and following the tragic death of Pierre Curie in 1906, she took his place as Professor of General Physics in the Faculty of Sciences, the first time a woman had held this position. She was also appointed Director of the Curie Laboratory in the Radium Institute of the University of Paris, founded in 1914.Her early researches, together with her husband, were often performed under difficult conditions, laboratory arrangements were poor and both had to undertake much teaching to earn a livelihood. The discovery of radioactivity by Henri Becquerel in 1896 inspired the Curies in their brilliant researches and analyses which led to the isolation of polonium, named after the country of Marie\\u2019s birth, and radium. Mme. Curie developed methods for the separation of radium from radioactive residues in sufficient quantities to allow for its characterization and the careful study of its properties, therapeutic properties in particular.Mme. Curie throughout her life actively promoted the use of radium to alleviate suffering and during World War I, assisted by her daughter, Irene, she personally devoted herself to this remedial work. She retained her enthusiasm for science throughout her life and did much to establish a radioactivity laboratory in her native city \\u2013 in 1929 President Hoover of the United States presented her with a gift of $ 50,000, donated by American friends of science, to purchase radium for use in the laboratory in Warsaw.Mme. Curie, quiet, dignified and unassuming, was held in high esteem and admiration by scientists throughout the world. She was a member of the Conseil du Physique Solvay from 1911 until her death and since 1922 she had been a member of the Committee of Intellectual Co-operation of the League of Nations. Her work is recorded in numerous papers in scientific journals and she is the author of Recherches sur les Substances Radioactives (1904), L\\u2019Isotopie et les \\u00c9l\\u00e9ments Isotopes and the classic Trait\\u00e9\\u2019 de Radioactivit\\u00e9 (1910).The importance of Mme. Curie\\u2019s work is reflected in the numerous awards bestowed on her. She received many honorary science, medicine and law degrees and honorary memberships of learned societies throughout the world. Together with her husband, she was awarded half of the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1903, for their study into the spontaneous radiation discovered by Becquerel, who was awarded the other half of the Prize. In 1911 she received a second Nobel Prize, this time in Chemistry, in recognition of her work in radioactivity. She also received, jointly with her husband, the Davy Medal of the Royal Society in 1903 and, in 1921, President Harding of the United States, on behalf of the women of America, presented her with one gram of radium in recognition of her service to science.For further details, cf.

He joined the African National Congress in 1944 and was engaged in resistance against the ruling National Party\\u2019s apartheid policies after 1948. He went on trial for treason in 1956-1961 and was acquitted in 1961.After the banning of the ANC in 1960, Nelson Mandela argued for the setting up of a military wing within the ANC. In June 1961, the ANC executive considered his proposal on the use of violent tactics and agreed that those members who wished to involve themselves in Mandela\\u2019s campaign would not be stopped from doing so by the ANC. This led to the formation of Umkhonto we Sizwe. Mandela was arrested in 1962 and sentenced to five years\\u2019 imprisonment with hard labour. In 1963, when many fellow leaders of the ANC and the Umkhonto we Sizwe were arrested, Mandela was brought to stand trial with them for plotting to overthrow the government by violence. His statement from the dock received considerable international publicity. On June 12, 1964, eight of the accused, including Mandela, were sentenced to life imprisonment. From 1964 to 1982, he was incarcerated at Robben Island Prison, off Cape Town; thereafter, he was at Pollsmoor Prison, nearby on the mainland.During his years in prison, Nelson Mandela\\u2019s reputation grew steadily.

He attended Loudoun Moor School, Darvel School, and Kilmarnock Academy before moving to London where he attended the Polytechnic. He spent four years in a shipping office before entering St. Mary\\u2019s Medical School, London University. He qualified with distinction in 1906 and began research at St. Mary\\u2019s under Sir Almroth Wright, a pioneer in vaccine therapy. He gained M.B., B.S., (London), with Gold Medal in 1908, and became a lecturer at St. Mary\\u2019s until 1914. He served throughout World War I as a captain in the Army Medical Corps, being mentioned in dispatches, and in 1918 he returned to St.Mary\\u2019s. He was elected Professor of the School in 1928 and Emeritus Professor of Bacteriology, University of London in 1948. He was elected Fellow of the Royal Society in 1943 and knighted in 1944.Early in his medical life, Fleming became interested in the natural bacterial action of the blood and in antiseptics. He was able to continue his studies throughout his military career and on demobilization he settled to work on antibacterial substances which would not be toxic to animal tissues. In 1921, he discovered in \\u00abtissues and secretions\\u00bb an important bacteriolytic substance which he named Lysozyme. About this time, he devised sensitivity titration methods and assays in human blood and other body fluids, which he subsequently used for the titration of penicillin. In 1928, while working on influenza virus, he observed that mould had developed accidently on a staphylococcus culture plate and that the mould had created a bacteria-free circle around itself. He was inspired to further experiment and he found that a mould culture prevented growth of staphylococci, even when diluted 800 times. He named the active substance penicillin.Sir Alexander wrote numerous papers on bacteriology, immunology and chemotherapy, including original descriptions of lysozyme and penicillin. They have been published in medical and scientific journals.Fleming, a Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons (England), 1909, and a Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians (London), 1944, has gained many awards. They include Hunterian Professor (1919), Arris and Gale Lecturer (1929) and Honorary Gold Medal (1946) of the Royal College of Surgeons; Williams Julius Mickle Fellowship, University of London (1942); Charles Mickle Fellowship, University of Toronto (1944); John Scott Medal, City Guild of Philadelphia (1944); Cameron Prize, University of Edinburgh (1945); Moxon Medal, Royal College of Physicians (1945); Cutter Lecturer, Harvard University (1945); Albert Gold Medal, Royal Society of Arts (1946); Gold Medal, Royal Society of Medicine (1947); Medal for Merit, U.S.A. (1947); and the Grand Cross of Alphonse X the Wise, Spain (1948).He served as President of the Society for General Microbiology, he was a Member of the Pontifical Academy of Science and Honorary Member of almost all the medical and scientific societies of the world. He was Rector of Edinburgh University during 1951-1954, Freeman of many boroughs and cities and Honorary Chief Doy-gei-tau of the Kiowa tribe. He was also awarded doctorate, honoris causa, degrees of almost thirty European and American Universities.In 1915, Fleming married Sarah Marion McElroy of Killala, Ireland, who died in 1949. Their son is a general medical practitioner.Fleming married again in 1953, his bride was Dr. Amalia Koutsouri-Voureka, a Greek colleague at St. Mary\\u2019s.In his younger days he was a keen member of the Territorial Army and he served from 1900 to 1914 as a private in the London Scottish Regiment.Dr Fleming died on March 11th in 1955 and is buried in St. Paul\\u2019s Cathedral.",

As a teenager, he played in various bands and with time his interest in music deepened, with a particular passion for American folk music and blues. One of his idols was the folk singer Woody Guthrie. He was also influenced by the early authors of the Beat Generation, as well as by modernist poets.Dylan moved to New York City in 1961 and began to perform in clubs and caf\\u00e9s in Greenwich Village. He met the record producer John Hammond, with whom he signed a contract for his debut album, Bob Dylan (1962). In the following years, he recorded a number of albums which have had a tremendous impact on popular music: Bringing It All Back Home and Highway 61 Revisited in 1965, Blonde On Blonde in 1966 and Blood On The Tracks in 1975. His productivity continued in the following decades, resulting in masterpieces like Oh Mercy (1989), Time Out of Mind (1997) and Modern Times (2006).Dylan\\u2019s tours in 1965 and 1966 attracted a lot of attention. For a period, he was accompanied by film maker D. A. Pennebaker, who documented life around the stage in what would come to be the movie Dont Look Back (1967). Dylan has recorded a large number of albums revolving around topics such as: the social conditions of man, religion, politics and love. The lyrics have continuously been published in new editions starting in 1973, under the title WritingsandDrawings, subsequently changed to Lyrics. As an artist, he is strikingly versatile; he has been active as a painter, actor and scriptwriter.Besides his large production of albums, Dylan has published experimental work like the prose poetry collection Tarantula (1971). He has written an autobiography, Chronicles (2004), which depicts memories from the early years in New York and which provides glimpses of his life at the center of popular culture. Since the late 1980s, Bob Dylan has toured consistently, playing over 3000 concerts during the last 20 years. Dylan has the status of an icon. His influence on contemporary culture is profound, and he is the object of a steady stream of literary and musical analysis.",

        "full-text": "Guglielmo Marconi was born at Bologna, Italy, on April 25, 1874, the second son of Giuseppe Marconi, an Italian country gentleman, and Annie Jameson, daughter of Andrew Jameson of Daphne Castle in the County Wexford, Ireland. He was educated privately at Bologna, Florence and Leghorn. Even as a boy he took a keen interest in physical and electrical science and studied the works of Maxwell, Hertz, Righi, Lodge and others. In 1895 he began laboratory experiments at his father\\u2019s country estate at Pontecchio where he succeeded in sending wireless signals over a distance of one and a half miles.In 1896 Marconi took his apparatus to England where he was introduced to Mr. (later Sir) William Preece, Engineer-in-Chief of the Post Office, and later that year was granted the world\\u2019s first patent for a system of wireless telegraphy. He demonstrated his system successfully in London, on Salisbury Plain and across the Bristol Channel, and in July 1897 formed The Wireless Telegraph & Signal Company Limited (in 1900 re-named Marconi\\u2019s Wireless Telegraph Company Limited). In the same year he gave a demonstration to the Italian Government at Spezia where wireless signals were sent over a distance of twelve miles. In 1899 he established wireless communication between France and England across the English Channel. He erected permanent wireless stations at The Needles, Isle of Wight, at Bournemouth and later at the Haven Hotel, Poole, Dorset.In 1900 he took out his famous patent No. 7777 for \\u201ctuned or syntonic telegraphy\\u201d and, on an historic day in December 1901, determined to prove that wireless waves were not affected by the curvature of the Earth, he used his system for transmitting the first wireless signals across the Atlantic between Poldhu, Cornwall, and St. John\\u2019s, Newfoundland, a distance of 2100 miles.Between 1902 and 1912 he patented several new inventions. In 1902, during a voyage in the American liner \\u201cPhiladelphia\\u201d, he first demonstrated \\u201cdaylight effect\\u201d relative to wireless communication and in the same year patented his magnetic detector which then became the standard wireless receiver for many years. In December 1902 he transmitted the first complete messages to Poldhu from stations at Glace Bay, Nova Scotia, and later Cape Cod, Massachusetts, these early tests culminating in 1907 in the opening of the first transatlantic commercial service between Glace Bay and Clifden, Ireland, after the first shorter-distance public service of wireless telegraphy had been established between Bari in Italy and Avidari in Montenegro. In 1905 he patented his horizontal directional aerial and in 1912 a \\u201ctimed spark\\u201d system for generating continuous waves.In 1914 he was commissioned in the Italian Army as a Lieutenant being later promoted to Captain, and in 1916 transferred to the Navy in the rank of Commander. He was a member of the Italian Government mission to the United States in 1917 and in 1919 was appointed Italian plenipotentiary delegate to the Paris Peace Conference. He was awarded the Italian Military Medal in 1919 in recognition of his war service.During his war service in Italy he returned to his investigation of short waves, which he had used in his first experiments. After further tests by his collaborators in England, an intensive series of trials was conducted in 1923 between experimental installations at the Poldhu Station and in Marconi\\u2019s yacht \\u201cElettra\\u201d cruising in the Atlantic and Mediterranean, and this led to the establishment of the beam system for long distance communication. Proposals to use this system as a means of Imperial communications were accepted by the British Government and the first beam station, linking England and Canada, was opened in 1926, other stations being added the following year.In 1931 Marconi began research into the propagation characteristics of still shorter waves, resulting in the opening in 1932 of the world\\u2019s first microwave radiotelephone link between the Vatican City and the Pope\\u2019s summer residence at Castel Gandolfo. Two years later at Sestri Levante he demonstrated his microwave radio beacon for ship navigation and in 1935, again in Italy, gave a practical demonstration of the principles of radar, the coming of which he had first foretold in a lecture to the American Institute of Radio Engineers in New York in 1922.He has been the recipient of honorary doctorates of several universities and many other international honours and awards, among them the Nobel Prize for Physics, which in 1909 he shared with Professor Karl Braun, the Albert Medal of the Royal Society of Arts, the John Fritz Medal and the Kelvin Medal. He was decorated by the Tsar of Russia with the Order of St. Anne, the King of Italy created him Commander of the Order of St. Maurice and St. Lazarus, and awarded him the Grand Cross of the Order of the Crown of Italy in 1902. Marconi also received the freedom of the City of Rome (1903), and was created Chevalier of the Civil Order of Savoy in 1905. Many other distinctions of this kind followed. In 1914 he was both created a Senatore in the Italian Senate and app ointed Honorary Knight Grand Cross of the Royal Victorian Order in England. He received the hereditary title of Marchese in 1929.In 1905 he married the Hon. Beatrice O\\u2019Brien, daughter of the 14th Baron Inchiquin, the marriage being annulled in 1927, in which year he married the Countess Bezzi-Scali of Rome. He had one son and two daughters by his first and one daughter by his second wife. His recreations were hunting, cycling and motoring.",

After the United States entered the First World War, he joined a volunteer ambulance unit in the Italian army. Serving at the front, he was wounded, was decorated by the Italian Government, and spent considerable time in hospitals. After his return to the United States, he became a reporter for Canadian and American newspapers and was soon sent back to Europe to cover such events as the Greek Revolution.During the twenties, Hemingway became a member of the group of expatriate Americans in Paris, which he described in his first important work, The Sun Also Rises (1926). Equally successful was A Farewell to Arms (1929), the study of an American ambulance officer\\u2019s disillusionment in the war and his role as a deserter. Hemingway used his experiences as a reporter during the civil war in Spain as the background for his most ambitious novel, For Whom the Bell Tolls (1940). Among his later works, the most outstanding is the short novel, The Old Man and the Sea (1952), the story of an old fisherman\\u2019s journey, his long and lonely struggle with a fish and the sea, and his victory in defeat.Hemingway \\u2013 himself a great sportsman \\u2013 liked to portray soldiers, hunters, bullfighters \\u2013 tough, at times primitive people whose courage and honesty are set against the brutal ways of modern society, and who in this confrontation lose hope and faith.

        "full-text": "Francis Harry Compton Crick was born on June 8th, 1916, at Northampton, England, being the elder child of Harry Crick and Annie Elizabeth Wilkins. He has one brother, A. F. Crick, who is a doctor in New Zealand.Crick was educated at Northampton Grammar School and Mill Hill School, London. He studied physics at University College, London, obtained a B.Sc. in 1937, and started research for a Ph.D. under Prof E. N. da C. Andrade, but this was interrupted by the outbreak of war in 1939. During the war he worked as a scientist for the British Admiralty, mainly in connection with magnetic and acoustic mines. He left the Admiralty in 1947 to study biology.Supported by a studentship from the Medical Research Council and with some financial help from his family, Crick went to Cambridge and worked at the Strangeways Research Laboratory. In 1949 he joined the Medical Research Council Unit headed by M. F. Perutz of which he has been a member ever since. This Unit was for many years housed in the Cavendish Laboratory Cambridge, but in 1962 moved into a large new building \\u2013 the Medical Research Council Laboratory of Molecular Biology \\u2013 on the New Hospital site. He became a research student for the second time in 1950, being accepted as a member of Caius College, Cambridge, and obtained a Ph.D. in 1954 on a thesis entitled \\u00abX-ray diffraction: polypeptides and proteins\\u00bb.During the academic year 1953-1954 Crick was on leave of absence at the Protein Structure Project of the Brooklyn Polytechnic in Brooklyn, New York. He has also lectured at Harvard, as a Visiting Professor, on two occasions, and has visited other laboratories in the States for short periods.In 1947 Crick knew no biology and practically no organic chemistry or crystallography, so that much of the next few years was spent in learning the elements of these subjects. During this period, together with W. Cochran and V. Vand he worked out the general theory of X-ray diffraction by a helix, and at the same time as L. Pauling and R. B. Corey, suggested that the alpha-keratin pattern was due to alpha-helices coiled round each other.A critical influence in Crick\\u2019s career was his friendship, beginning in 1951, with J. D. Watson, then a young man of 23, leading in 1953 to the proposal of the double-helical structure for DNA and the replication scheme. Crick and Watson subsequently suggested a general theory for the structure of small viruses.Crick in collaboration with A. Rich has proposed structures for polyglycine II and collagen and (with A. Rich, D. R. Davies, and J. D.Watson) a structure for polyadenylic acid.In recent years Crick, in collaboration with S. Brenner, has concentrated more on biochemistry and genetics leading to ideas about protein synthesis (the \\u00abadaptor hypothesis\\u00bb), and the genetic code, and in particular to work on acridine-type mutants.Crick was made an F.R.S. in 1959. He was awarded the Prix Charles Leopold Meyer of the French Academy of Sciences in 1961, and the Award of Merit of the Gairdner Foundation in 1962. Together with J. D. Watson he was a Warren Triennial Prize Lecturer in 1959 and received a Research Corporation Award in 1962. With J. D. Watson and M. H. F. Wilkins he was presented with a Lasker Foundation Award in 1960. In 1962 he was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and a Fellow of University College, London. He was a Fellow of Churchill College, Cambridge, in 1960-1961, and is now a non-resident Fellow of the Salk Institute for Biological Studies, San Diego, California.In 1940 Crick married Ruth Doreen Dodd. Their son, Michael F. C. Crick is a scientist. They were divorced in 1947. In 1949 Crick married Odile Speed. They have two daughters, Gabrielle A. Crick and Jacqueline M. T. Crick. The family lives in a house appropriately called \\u00abThe Golden Helix\\u00bb, in which Crick likes to find his recreation in conversation with his friends.",

After a brief but eventful career in the army, he became a Conservative Member of Parliament in 1900. He held many high posts in Liberal and Conservative governments during the first three decades of the century. At the outbreak of the Second World War, he was appointed First Lord of the Admiralty \\u2013 a post which he had earlier held from 1911 to 1915. In May, 1940, he became Prime Minister and Minister of Defence and remained in office until 1945. He took over the premiership again in the Conservative victory of 1951 and resigned in 1955. However, he remained a Member of Parliament until the general election of 1964, when he did not seek re-election. Queen Elizabeth II conferred on Churchill the dignity of Knighthood and invested him with the insignia of the Order of the Garter in 1953. Among the other countless honours and decorations he received, special mention should be made of the honorary citizenship of the United States which President Kennedy conferred on him in 1963.Churchill\\u2019s literary career began with campaign reports: The Story of the Malakand Field Force (1898) and The River War (1899), an account of the campaign in the Sudan and the Battle of Omdurman. In 1900, he published his only novel, Savrola, and, six years later, his first major work, the biography of his father, Lord Randolph Churchill. His other famous biography, the life of his great ancestor, the Duke of Marlborough, was published in four volumes between 1933 and 1938. Churchill\\u2019s history of the First World War appeared in four volumes under the title of The World Crisis (1923-29); his memoirs of the Second World War ran to six volumes (1948-1953/54). After his retirement from office, Churchill wrote a History of the English-speaking Peoples (4 vols., 1956-58). His magnificent oratory survives in a dozen volumes of speeches, among them The Unrelenting Struggle (1942), The Dawn of Liberation (1945), and Victory (1946).Churchill, a gifted amateur painter, wrote Painting as a Pastime (1948).

        "full-text": "Albert Abraham Michelson was born in Strelno, Prussia, on December 19, 1852. Two years later his family emigrated to the United States to settle at Virginia City, Nevada, but they eventually moved to San Francisco where Michelson received his early education in public schools, matriculating from the High School in 1869. He was appointed by President Grant to the U.S. Naval Academy and, after graduation as Ensign in 1873 and a two-years\\u2019 cruise in the West Indies, he became an instructor in physics and chemistry at the Academy under Admiral Sampson. In 1879, he was posted to the Nautical Almanac Office, Washington, to work with Simon Newcomb, but in the following year, he obtained leave of absence to continue his studies in Europe. He visited the Universities of Berlin and Heidelberg, and the College de France and \\u00c9cole Polytechnique in Paris. He resigned from the Navy and in 1883 returned to America to take an appointment as Professor of Physics in the Case School of Applied Science, Cleveland, Ohio. In 1890 he accepted a similar position at Clark University, Worcester, Massachusetts, and in 1892 he became Professor of Physics and the first Head of Department at the new University of Chicago. He rejoined the Navy during World War I, and in 1918 returned to Chicago where in 1925 he was appointed to the first of the Distinguished Service Professorships. Michelson resigned in 1929 to work at the Mount Wilson Observatory, Pasadena.During his career, Michelson touched on many departments of physics but, perhaps due to a special instinct which he appeared to possess, he excelled in optics. He performed early measurements of the velocity of light with amazing delicacy and in 1881 he invented his interferometer for the purpose of discovering the effect of the Earth\\u2019s motion on the observed velocity. In cooperation with Professor E.W. Morley, and using the interferometer, it was shown that light travels at a constant speed in all inertial systems of reference. The instrument also enabled distances to be measured with greater accuracy by means of the length of light-waves. At the request of the International Committee of Weights and Measures, Michelson measured the standard metre in terms of wavelength of cadmium light. He invented the echelon spectroscope and during his wartime service in the Navy he performed research work on devices for naval use \\u2013 he developed a rangefinder which was adapted as part of U.S. Navy equipment. On his return to civilian life, Michelson became more interested in astronomy and in 1920, using light interference and a highly developed version of his earlier instrument, he measured the diameter of the star Betelgeuse: this was the first determination of the size of a star that could be regarded as accurate.Michelson has contributed numerous papers to many scientific periodicals and among his more substantial works are the classics, Velocity of Light (1902) Light Waves and their Uses (1899-1903); and Studies in Optics (1927).Michelson was honoured by memberships of many learned societies throughout America and ten European countries, and he received honorary science and law degrees from ten American and foreign universities. He was President of the American Physical Society (1900), the American Association for the Advancement of Science (1910-1911), and the National Academy of Sciences (1923-1927). He was also a Fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society, the Royal Society of London and the Optical Society, an Associate of l\\u2019Acad\\u00e9mie Fran\\u00e7aise and among the many awards he has received are the Matteucci Medal (Societ\\u00e1 Italiana), 1904; Copley Medal (Royal Society), 1907; Elliot Cresson Medal (Franklin Institute), 1912; Draper Medal (National Academy of Sciences), 1916; Franklin Medal (Franklin Institute) and the Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society, 1923; and the Duddell Medal (Physical Society), 1929.Michelson married Edna Stanton of Lake Forest, Illinois in 1899.

In the western world my birthplace has a somewhat sinister reputation that was characterized by an older tax-inspector in the Midwest of America as \\u201cthe place where all that mess started\\u201d. Actually, as an 8 years old boy I stood near to the spot where Archiduke Franz Ferdinand and his wife were assassinated. At the beginning of the first World War, in 1915, we moved to Zagreb, the capital of Croatia, where I attended the gymnasium. The period 1924 to 1929 was spent studying Chemistry at the Czech Institute of Technology in Prague, Czechoslovakia. The supervisor of my thesis was Professor Emil Votocek, one of the prominent founders of chemical research in Czechoslovakia. My mentor, however, was Rudolf Lukes, then lecturer and later successor of Votocek to the chair of organic chemistry. To Lukes I owe the greatest part of my early scientific education, and he remained my close friend until his premature death in 1960. In addition to these two \\u201creal\\u201d teachers I admired Robert Robinson, Christopher Ingold and Leopold Ruzicka, all of whom I considered as my \\u201cimaginary\\u201d teachers. In later years I was fortunate to become well acquainted with all three of these great chemists.The close of my studies with a degree of a Dr. Ing. in 1929 coincided with the great economic crisis, and I was not able to find an academic position. I was therefore very grateful for a position in the newly created laboratory of G.J. Dr\\u00edza in Prague where rare chemicals were produced on small scale. I had there also a modest opportunity to do some research, but I badly wanted to work in an academic environment. This is why I was so eager to accept the position of a lecturer at the University of Zagreb in 1935. I did not know that I had to fulfil there all the duties of a full professor and to live on a salary of an underpaid assistant, but it would probably not have affected my decision if I had known. With the help of a couple of enthusiastic young co-workers and of a developing small pharmaceutical factory, I had just managed to solve at least the most urgent problems for myself and my laboratory when the second World War broke out. After the German occupation of Zagreb in 1941 it became clear that I was likely to get into serious trouble if I remained there. At this critical point I received an invitation of Richard Kuhn to give some lectures in Germany, and shortly afterwards Leopold Ruzicka, whom I had asked for help, invited me to visit him on the way. With these two invitations, it was possible for me to escape with my wife to Switzerland. Through Ruzicka I soon obtained generous support of CIBA Ltd. and started work in the Organic Chemistry Laboratory at the Federal Institute of Technology (ETH) in Zurich. The cooperation with Ruzicka lasted many years and enabled me to make my slow progress up the academic hierarchical ladder. Starting as assistant, I became \\u201cPrivat Dozent\\u201d, \\u201cTitularprofessor\\u201d associate (ausserordentlicher) professor and in 1952 full professor ad personam. Finally, in 1957, I succeeded Ruzicka as head of the Laboratory, a height that I never dreamt of when I was a student in Prague. In becoming director of the Laboratory I reached, according to Peter\\u2019s principle, the level of my incompetence and I tried hard for several years to step down. Surrounded and supported by a group of very able young colleagues, I finally succeeded in introducing a rotating chairmanship from which I was exempted. So far this has worked very satisfactorily and it may have helped some of my colleagues to resist tempting offers from other Universities.My main interests were natural compounds, from adamantane and aialoids to rifamycins and boromycin. During the work on natural compounds stereochemical problems emerged from all sides. As E.L. Eliel pointed out, stereochemistry is not so much a branch of chemistry but rather a way of looking at chemistry. It was, and still is, great fun trying to find new points of view for it.I travel a lot. Recently I counted that I have given lectures in more than 150 places, often several times. This in spite of the fact that I do not speak any language properly. I suspect that many people come to my lectures because they enjoy my strange accent and skill in managing without actually cheating.I married my wife Kamila in Prague in 1933. A son Jan was born to us in Z\\u00fcrich in 1949.For many years, when still a Yugoslav citizen, I was already a Swiss patriot and in 1959 I obtained Swiss citizenship. However, I consider myself a world citizen and I am very grateful to my adopted country that it allows me to be one.The way from Sarajevo to Stockholm is a long one and I am fully aware that I have been very lucky to arrive there. The journey could not have been made without the generous help of friends, colleagues, co-workers and also of innumerable earlier chemists \\u201con whose shoulders we stand\\u201d.",

        "full-text": "Albert Schweitzer (January 14, 1875-September 4, 1965) was born into an Alsatian family which for generations had been devoted to religion, music, and education. His father and maternal grandfather were ministers; both of his grandfathers were talented organists; many of his relatives were persons of scholarly attainments.Schweitzer entered into his intensive theological studies in 1893 at the University of Strasbourg where he obtained a doctorate in philosophy in 1899, with a dissertation on the religious philosophy of Kant, and received his licentiate in theology in 1900. He began preaching at St. Nicholas Church in Strasbourg in 1899; he served in various high ranking administrative posts from 1901 to 1912 in the Theological College of St.Thomas, the college he had attended at the University of Strasbourg. In 1906 he published The Quest of the Historical Jesus, a book on which much of his fame as a theological scholar rests.Meanwhile he continued with a distinguished musical career initiated at an early age with piano and organ lessons. Only nine when he first performed in his father\\u2019s church, he was, from his young manhood to his middle eighties, recognized as a concert organist, internationally known. From his professional engagements he earned funds for his education, particularly his later medical schooling, and for his African hospital. Musicologist as well as performer, Schweitzer wrote a biography of Bach in 1905 in French, published a book on organ building and playing in 1906, and rewrote the Bach book in German in 1908.Having decided to go to Africa as a medical missionary rather than as a pastor, Schweitzer in 1905 began the study of medicine at the University of Strasbourg. In 1913, having obtained his M.D. degree, he founded his hospital at Lambar\\u00e9n\\u00e9 in French Equatorial Africa, but in 1917 he and his wife were sent to a French internment camp as prisoners of war. Released in 1918, Schweitzer spent the next six years in Europe, preaching in his old church, giving lectures and concerts, taking medical courses, writing On the Edge of the Primeval Forest, The Decay and Restoration of Civilization, Civilization and Ethics, and Christianity and the Religions of the World.Schweitzer returned to Lambar\\u00e9n\\u00e9 in 1924 and except for relatively short periods of time, spent the remainder of his life there. With the funds earned from his own royalties and personal appearance fees and with those donated from all parts of the world, he expanded the hospital to seventy buildings which by the early 1960\\u2019s could take care of over 500 patients in residence at any one time.At Lambar\\u00e9n\\u00e9, Schweitzer was doctor and surgeon in the hospital, pastor of a congregation, administrator of a village, superintendent of buildings and grounds, writer of scholarly books, commentator on contemporary history, musician, host to countless visitors. The honors he received were numerous, including the Goethe Prize of Frankfurt and honorary doctorates from many universities emphasizing one or another of his achievements. The Nobel Peace Prize for 1952, having been withheld in that year, was given to him on December 10, 1953. With the $33,000 prize money, he started the leprosarium at Lambar\\u00e9n\\u00e9.Albert Schweitzer died on September 4, 1965, and was buried at Lambar\\u00e9n\\u00e9.Copyright \\u00a9 The Nobel Foundation 1952Selected BibliographyAnderson, Erica, The Schweitzer Album.

        "full-text": "Linus Carl Pauling was born in Portland, Oregon, on 28th February, 1901, the son of a druggist, Herman Henry William Pauling, who, though born in Missouri, was of German descent, and his wife, Lucy Isabelle Darling, born in Oregon of English-Scottish ancestry.Linus attended the public elementary and high schools in the town of Condon and the city of Portland, Oregon, and entered the Oregon State College in 1917, receiving the degree of B.Sc. in chemical engineering in 1922. During the years 1919-1920 he served as a full-time teacher of quantitative analysis in the State College, after which he was appointed a Teaching Fellow in Chemistry in the California Institute of Technology and was a graduate student there from 1922 to 1925, working under Professor Roscoe G. Dickinson and Richard C. Tolman. In 1925 he was awarded the Ph.D. (summa cum laude) in chemistry, with minors in physics and mathematics.Since 1919 his interest lay in the field of molecular structure and the nature of the chemical bond, inspired by papers by Irving Langmuir on the application of the Lewis theory of the sharing of pairs of electrons between atoms to many substances. In 1921 he suggested, and attempted to carry out, an experiment on the orientation of iron atoms by a magnetic field, through the electrolytic deposition of a layer of iron in a strong magnetic field and the determination of the orientation of the iron crystallises by polishing and etching the deposit, and microscopic examination of the etch figures. With Professor Dickinson, he began in 1922 the experimental determination of the structures of some crystals, and also started theoretical work on the nature of the chemical bond.Since his appointment to the Staff of California Institute of Technology, Professor Pauling was elected Research Associate in 1925; National Research Fellow in Chemistry, 1925-1926; Fellow of the John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation, 1926-1927 (through this last he worked in European Universities with Sommerfeld, Schr\\u00f6dinger, and Bohr); Assistant Professor of Chemistry, 1927-1929; Associate Professor, 1929-1931; Professor, 1931, when he was the first recipient of the American Chemical Society Award in Pure Chemistry \\u2013 the Langmuir Prize \\u2013 and Chairman of the Division of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, and Director of the Gates and Crellin laboratories of Chemistry, 1936-1958. In 1963, he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.Pauling is a member of numerous professional societies in the U.S.A. as well as in many European countries, India, Japan and Chile. Awards, medals, and honorary degrees were showered upon him in America and Europe, and in addition he was elected Rationalist of the Year for 1960 and Humanist of the Year for 1961. Several books have come from his pen, ranging from his most famous one The Nature of the Chemical Bond, and the Structure of Molecules and Crystals (1939, 1949, 1960) via General Chemistry (1947, 1953), which was translated into nine languages, to No More War! (1958, 1959,1962).The subjects of the papers he published reflect his great scientific versatility: about 350 publications in the fields of experimental determination of the structure of crystals by the diffraction of X-rays and the interpretation of these structures in terms of the radii and other properties of atoms; the application of quantum mechanics to physical and chemical problems, including dielectric constants, X-ray doublets, momentum distribution of electrons in atoms, rotational motion of molecules in crystals, Van der Waals forces, etc.; the structure of metals and intermetallic compounds, the theory of ferromagnetism; the nature of the chemical bond, including the resonance phenomenon in chemistry; the experimental determination of the structure of gas molecules by the diffraction of electrons; the structure of proteins; the structure of antibodies and the nature of serological reactions; the structure and properties of hemoglobin and related substances; abnormal hemoglobin molecules in relation to the hereditary hemolytic anemias; the molecular theory of general anesthesia; an instrument for determining the partial pressure of oxygen in a gas; and other subjects.Pauling married Ava Helen Miller of Beaver Creek, Oregon, in 1923. She is of English-Scottish and German descent. They have four children, Linus (Carl) Jr. (1925), Peter Jeffress (1931), Linda Helen (1932) and Edward Crellin (1937), and thirteen grandchildren.",

        "full-text": "Otto Hahn was born on 8th March, 1879, at Frankfurt-on-Main. He attended the secondary high school there until he matriculated.From 1897 Hahn studied chemistry at Marburg and Munich, taking his doctorate examination in 1901 at Marburg and submitting to Professor Theodor Zincke a thesis on organic chemistry.He obtained a post as assistant in the Chemical Institute at Marburg, staying there two years, after which he worked under Sir William Ramsay at University College, London, from the autumn of 1904 to the following summer. His work here was rewarded by the discovery of a new radioactive substance, radiothorium, while working on the preparation of pure radium salts.From the autumn of 1905 to the summer of the following year Hahn was at the Physical Institute of McGill University, Montreal (Canada) working under Professor Ernest Rutherford. Here he discovered radioactinium and conducted investigations with Rutherford on alpha-rays of radiothorium and radioactinium.On his return to Europe Hahn moved to Berlin, to the Chemical Institute (Emil Fischer) of the University and there he qualified as a university lecturer in the spring of 1907, which year also saw his discovery of mesothorium.At the end of 1907, Dr. Lise Meitner came to Berlin from Vienna and then began more than thirty years\\u2019 collaboration. Their joint work embraced: investigations on beta-rays, their absorbability, magnetic spectra, etc.; use of the radioactive recoil, discovered shortly before by Hahn, to obtain new radioactive transformation products.Between 1914 and 1918 Hahn\\u2019s work was interrupted by his service in the First World War, but he resumed his research with Professor Meitner in 1918, and discovered protactinium, the long-lived mother substance of the actinium series. Hahn\\u2019s own particular sphere was chemistry and he further discovered uranium Z, the first case of a nuclear isomerism of radioactive kinds of atoms. Using radioactive methods he investigated the absorption and precipitation of the smallest quantities of substances, normal and abnormal formation of crystals, etc. Hahn used the emanation method to test substances superficially rich or poor, and he elaborated the strontium method to determine the age of geological periods.Following the discovery of artificial radioactivity by M and Mme. Joliot-Curie and the use of neutrons by Fermi for atomic nuclear processes, Hahn again collaborated with Professor Meitner and afterwards with Dr. Strassmann on the processes of irradiating uranium and thorium with neutrons.Hahn and Prof. Meitner had also worked together on the discovery of an artificially active uranium isotope, which represents the basic substance of the elements neptunium and plutonium, first revealed later in America.Hahn\\u2019s work has won recognition in many learned circles. In 1912 he became scientific member of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Chemistry and has been Director of this Institute since 1928. 1933 saw his appointment as Visiting Professor at Cornell University, Ithaca, New York. From 1st April, 1946, he has officiated as President of the Kaiser Wilhelm Society and from 28th February, 1948, has served as President of the Max Planck Society in Western Germany, being created Honorary President of the same Society in May, 1960.His most spectacular discovery came at the end of 1938. While working jointly with Dr. Strassmann, Hahn discovered the fission of uranium and thorium in medium heavy atomic nuclei and his first work on these subjects appeared on 6th January and 10th February, 1939, in Naturwissenschaften. Since that time and until 1944 Hahn continued investigation on the proof and separation of many elements and kinds of atoms which arise through fission.Hahn has been granted membership of the Academies of Berlin, G\\u00f6ttingen, Munich, Halle, Stockholm, Vienna, Boston, Madrid, Helsinki, Lisbon, Mainz, Rome (Vatican), Allahabad, Copenhagen, and the Indian Academy of Sciences.In 1913 Hahn married Edith, n\\u00e9e Junghans and they had one son, Hanno, born in 1922, killed by accident in 1960.",

        "full-text": "Otto Loewi was born on June 3, 1873, in Frankfurt-am-Main, Germany, the son of Jacob Loewi, a merchant, and Anna Willst\\u00e4tter.After having attended the humanistic Gymnasium (grammar school) in his native town, he entered in 1891 the Universities of Munich and Strassburg (at that time part of Germany) as a medical student. Apart from his attendance at the inspiring anatomy courses of Gustav Schwalbe, however, he seldom went to the medical lectures, being more inclined towards those held at the philosophical faculty. Only in the summer of 1893 did he seriously prepare for his \\u00abPhysicum\\u00bb, the first medical examination, which he just managed to pass. It was not until the autumn of 1894 that his indifference to medicine suddenly gave way to almost enthusiastic interest. In 1896 he took his doctor\\u2019s degree at Strassburg University, his thesis dealing with a subject suggested by Professor Oswald Schmiedeberg, the famous \\u00abFather of Pharmacology\\u00bb. Also responsible for his medical education were: Bernhard Naunyn, distinguished clinician and experimental pathologist, Oscar Minkowski, and Adolph Magnus-Levy.After his graduation he followed a course in inorganic analytical chemistry with Martin Freund, in Frankfurt, and afterwards spent a few months working in the biochemical institute of Franz Hofmeister in Strassburg. During 1897-1898 he was assistant to Carl von Noorden, clinician at the City Hospital in Frankfurt. Soon, however, after seeing the high mortality in countless cases of far-advanced tuberculosis and pneumonia, left without any treatment because of lack of therapy, he decided to drop his intention to become a clinician and instead to carry out research in basic medical science, in particular pharmacology. In 1898 he succeeded in becoming an assistant of Professor Hans Horst Meyer, the renowned pharmacologist at the University of Marburg-an-der-Lahn, from 1904 Professor of Pharmacology in Vienna. In 1905 Loewi became Associate Professor at Meyer\\u2019s laboratory, and in 1909 he was appointed to the Chair of Pharmacology in Graz.During his first years in Marburg, Loewi\\u2019s studies were in the field of metabolism. As a result of his work on the action of phlorhizin, a glucoside provoking glycosuria, and another one on nuclein metabolism in man, he was appointed \\u00abPrivatdozent\\u00bb (Lecturer) in 1900. Two years later he published his paper \\u00ab\\u00dcber Eiweiss-synthese im Tierk\\u00f6rper\\u00bb (On protein synthesis in the animal body), proving that animals are able to rebuild their proteins from their degradation products, the amino acids \\u2013 an essential discovery with regard to nutrition.That same year he also published the first part of a series of papers about experimental contributions to the physiology and pharmacology of kidney function.In 1902 Loewi also spent some months in Starling\\u2019s laboratory, in London, where he also worked with W. M. Bayliss, Starling\\u2019s brother-in-law. And it was in this laboratory that he first met his lifelong friend Henry Dale, who was later to share the Nobel Prize with him.After his return to Marburg in 1902 Loewi continued to study the function of the kidney and the mechanism of the action of diuretics. On his arrival in Vienna in 1905 he again took up the problems connected with carbohydrate metabolism. He proved thereby that preference for fructose rather than glucose is not only characteristic of pancreatectomized dogs, as earlier demonstrated by Minkowski, but also of dogs deprived of their glycogen by other means, e.g. by phosphorus poisoning. He also proved that the heart in contrast to the liver, cannot utilize fructose. And finally that epinephrine injections into rabbits completely depleted of their liver glycogen by starvation brought the glycogen back to almost normal values in spite of continued starvation. His other investigations in Vienna, done jointly with Alfred Fr\\u00f6hlich, dealt with the vegetative nervous system (stimulated by the discovery made by Gaskell and Langley of the existence of two divisions of this nervous system, and also as a result of his coming into contact with T.R. Elliott in Cambridge, where the latter was conducting his final experiments on the action of epinephrine). His classic paper in this field was published in 1905, the best-known result of these studies being the observation that small doses of cocaine potentiate the responses of sympathetically innervated organs to epinephrine and sympathetic nerve stimulation.It was as Professor in Graz that Loewi cultivated his gifts as a lecturer. A number of his associates during this period came from the U.S.A. Loewi continued his studies of carbohydrate metabolism, investigating among other things the conditions responsible for epinephrine hyperglycaemia.In 1921 Loewi discovered the chemical transmission of nerve impulses the research of which was greatly developed by him and his co-workers in the years following, culminating ultimately in his demonstration that the parasympathetic substance (\\u00abVagusstoff\\u00bb) is acetylcholine and that a substance closely related to adrenaline played a corresponding role at the sympathetic nerve endings. It was for these researches that he received the Nobel Prize in 1936, jointly with Sir Henry Dale. This and other discoveries in the fields of chemistry, physics, and pharmacology have since then led to a complete renewal of the concepts of the sympathetic nervous system.When the Germans invaded Austria in 1938, Loewi was forced to leave his homeland. (But only after he had been compelled to instruct the Swedish bank in Stockholm to transfer the Nobel Prize money to a prescribed Nazi-controlled bank.)After spending some time as Visiting Professor at the Universit\\u00e9 Libre in Brussels, and at the Nuffield Institute, Oxford, Loewi accepted an invitation to join the College of Medicine, New York University, as Research Professor of Pharmacology, and to work in George Wallace\\u2019s Laboratory. He arrived in the United States in 1940. In America Loewi came into close contact with many outstanding biologists from all over the world and here he found much inspiration for his work.Loewi held honorary degrees from New York University, Yale University, and from the Universities of Graz and Frankfurt. He was recipient of the Physiology Prize of the Royal Academy of Sciences of Bologna, of the Lieben Prize of the Academy of Vienna, and of the Cameron Prize of the University of Edinburgh (1944). He was an Honorary Member of the Physiological Society (London), of the Harvey Society (New York), and of the Societ\\u00e0 Italiana di Biologia Sperimentale; he was also Corresponding Member of the Society of Physicians in Vienna, of the Viennese Biological Society, and of the Society for the Advancement of Natural Sciences in Marburg-an-der-Lahn; and was Member of the Deutsche Akademie der Naturforscher Leopoldina, in Halle. In 1954 he was appointed Foreign Member of the Royal Society.Since his schooldays, Loewi showed keen interest in the humanities. He always enjoyed music, architecture, and painting, and in his younger years seldom missed an opportunity to visit museums and exhibitions.In 1908 he married Guida Goldschmiedt, daughter of Dr. Guido Goldschmiedt, then Professor of Chemistry in Prague, and later in Vienna. They had three sons, Hans, Victor, Guido; and one daughter, Anna. Professor Loewi became an American citizen in 1946. He died December 25, 1961.",

        "full-text": "Yuan Tseh Lee was born on November 19, 1936 in Hsinchu, Taiwan. His father is an accomplished artist and his mother a school teacher.He started his early education while Taiwan was under Japanese occupation \\u2013 a result of a war between China and Japan in 1894. His elementary education was disrupted soon after it started during World War II while the city populace was relocated to the mountains to avoid the daily bombing by the Allies. It was not until after the war when Taiwan was returned to China that he was able to attend school normally as a third year student in grade school.His elementary and secondary education in Hsinchu was rather colorful and full of fun. In elementary school, he was the second baseman on the school\\u2019s baseball team as well as a member of the ping-pong team which won the little league championship in Taiwan. In high school he played on the tennis team besides playing trombone in the marching band.Besides his interest in sports during this time, he was also an avid and serious reader of a wide variety of books covering science, literature, and social science. The biography of Madame Curie made a strong impact on him at a young age. It was Madame Curie\\u2019s beautiful life as a wonderful human being, her dedication toward science, her selflessness, idealism that made him decide to be a scientist.In 1955, with his excellent academic performance in high school, Lee was admitted to the National Taiwan University without having to take the entrance examination, a practice the Universities took to admit the best students. By the end of his freshman year he had decided chemistry was to be his chosen field. Although the facilities in the Taiwan University were less than ideal, the free and exciting atmosphere, the dedication of some professors, and the camaraderie among fellow students in a way made up for it. He worked under Professor Hua-sheng Cheng on his B.S. thesis which was on the separation of Sr and Ba using the paper electrophoresis method.After graduation in 1959, he went on to the National Tsinghua University to do his graduate work. He received his Master\\u2019s degree on the studies of the natural radioisotopes contained in Hukutolite, a mineral of hot spring sediment under Professor H. Hamaguchi\\u2019s guidance. After receiving his M.S. he stayed on at Tsinghua University as a research assistant of Professor C.H. Wong and carried out the x-ray structure determination of tricyclopentadienyl samarium.He entered the University of California at Berkeley as a graduate student in 1962. He worked under the late Professor Bruce Mahan for his thesis research on chemi-ionization processes of electronically excited alkali atoms. During his graduate student years, he developed an interest in ion-molecule reactions and the dynamics of molecular scattering, especially the crossed molecular beam studies of reaction dynamics.Upon receiving his Ph.D. degree in 1965, he stayed on in Mahan\\u2019s group and started to work on ion molecule reactive scattering experiments with Ron Gentry using ion beam techniques measuring energy and angular distributions. In a period of about a year he learned the art of designing and constructing a very powerful scattering apparatus and carried out successful experiments on N2+ + H2 \\u2013> N2H+ + H and obtained a complete product distribution contour map, a remarkable accomplishment at that time.In February 1967, he joined Professor Dudley Herschbach at Harvard University as a post-doctoral fellow. He spent half his time working with Robert Gordon on the reactions of hydrogen atoms and diatomic alkali molecules and the other half of his time on the construction of a universal crossed molecular beams apparatus with Doug McDonald and Pierre LeBreton. Time was certainly ripe to move the crossed molecular beams method beyond the alkali age. With tremendous effort and valuable assistance from the machine shop foreman, George Pisiello, the machine was completed in ten months and the first successful non alkali neutral beam experiment on Cl + Br2 \\u2013> BrCl + Br was carried out in late 1967.He accepted the position as an assistant professor in the Department of Chemistry and the James Franck Institute of the University of Chicago in October 1968. There he started an illustrious academic career. His further development as a creative scientist and his construction of a new generation state-of-the-art crossed molecular beams apparatus enabled him to carry out numerous exciting and pioneering experiments with his students. He was promoted to associate professor in October 1971 and professor in January 1973.In 1974, he returned to Berkeley as professor of chemistry and principal investigator at the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory of the University of California. He became an American citizen the same year.In the ensuing years, his scientific efforts blossomed and the scope expanded. His world leading laboratory now contains seven very sophisticated molecular beams apparati which were specially designed to pursue problems associated with reaction dynamics, photochemical processes, and molecular spectroscopy. His laboratory has always attracted bright scientists from all over the world and they always seem to enjoy working together. He takes great pride in the fact that more than fifteen of his former associates are serving as professors in major universities, and many others are making great contributions at the national laboratories and in the private sector.Lee and his wife, Bernice Wu, whom he first met in elementary school have two sons, Ted (born in 1963), Sidney (born in 1966) and a daughter, Charlotte (born in 1969).",

As a teenager, he played in various bands and with time his interest in music deepened, with a particular passion for American folk music and blues. One of his idols was the folk singer Woody Guthrie. He was also influenced by the early authors of the Beat Generation, as well as by modernist poets.Dylan moved to New York City in 1961 and began to perform in clubs and caf\\u00e9s in Greenwich Village. He met the record producer John Hammond, with whom he signed a contract for his debut album, Bob Dylan (1962). In the following years, he recorded a number of albums which have had a tremendous impact on popular music: Bringing It All Back Home and Highway 61 Revisited in 1965, Blonde On Blonde in 1966 and Blood On The Tracks in 1975. His productivity continued in the following decades, resulting in masterpieces like Oh Mercy (1989), Time Out of Mind (1997) and Modern Times (2006).Dylan\\u2019s tours in 1965 and 1966 attracted a lot of attention. For a period, he was accompanied by film maker D. A. Pennebaker, who documented life around the stage in what would come to be the movie Dont Look Back (1967). Dylan has recorded a large number of albums revolving around topics such as: the social conditions of man, religion, politics and love. The lyrics have continuously been published in new editions starting in 1973, under the title WritingsandDrawings, subsequently changed to Lyrics. As an artist, he is strikingly versatile; he has been active as a painter, actor and scriptwriter.Besides his large production of albums, Dylan has published experimental work like the prose poetry collection Tarantula (1971). He has written an autobiography, Chronicles (2004), which depicts memories from the early years in New York and which provides glimpses of his life at the center of popular culture. Since the late 1980s, Bob Dylan has toured consistently, playing over 3000 concerts during the last 20 years. Dylan has the status of an icon.

Houssay on the role of the adrenalin carbohydrate metabolism. In 1936 he worked at the Biochemical Laboratory of Cambridge, England, which was directed by Sir Frederick Gowland Hopkins. There he collaborated with Malcom Dixon, N.L. Edson and D.E. Green. On returning to Buenos Aires he worked with J.M. Mu\\u00f1oz on the oxidation of fatty acids in liver, and also together with E. Braun Men\\u00e9ndez, J.C. Fasciolo and A.C. Taquini on the formation of angiotensin. In 1944 he was Research Assistant in Dr. Carl F.

Since then he has been Director of the Instituto de Investigaciones Bioqu\\u00edmicas, Fundaci\\u00f3n Campomar. With his early collaborators, Ranwel Caputto, Carlos E. Cardini, Ra\\u00fal Trucco and Alejandro C. Paladini work was started on the metabolism of galactose which led to the isolation of glucose 1,6-diphosphate and uridine diphosphate glucose. The latter substance was then found to act as glucose donor in the synthesis of trehalose (with Enrico Cabib, 1953 ) and sucrose (with Carlos E. Cardini and J.Chiriboga, 1955). Other sugar nucleotides such as uridine diphosphate acetylglucosamine and guanosine diphosphate mannose were also isolated. Further work showed that uridine diphosphate glucose is involved in glycogen synthesis and adenosine diphosphate glucose in that of starch.More recent investigations (with Nicol\\u00e1s Behrens) have dealt with the role of a polyprenol, dolichol, in glucose transfer in animal tissues.Luis Leloir was married in 1943 to Amelia Zuberbuhler and has a daughter, Amelia.

        "full-text": "Alva Myrdal was born in Uppsala in 1902, graduated from University in 1924, and married Gunnar Myrdal the same year. Together with her husband she made a major contribution in the 1930s to the work of promoting social welfare. They were joint authors of a book entitled \\u201cThe population problem in crisis\\u201d, and she was also actively engaged in the discussion on housing and school problems. She was a prominent member of the Social Democrat Party in Sweden, and in 1943 was appointed to that party\\u2019s committee with the task of drafting a post-war programme. Also in that year she was appointed to the Government Commission on International Post-War Aid and Reconstruction.After the second world war she devoted more and more of her time and energy to international questions. In 1949 \\u2013 1950 she headed UNO\\u2019s section dealing with welfare policy, and in 1950 \\u2013 1955 she was chairman of UNESCO\\u2019s social science section. In 1955 she was appointed Swedish ambassador to India, and in 1962 was nominated Sweden\\u2019s representative to the Geneva disarmament conference. In that year she became a member of Parliament and in 1967 a member of the Cabinet, entrusted with the special task of promoting disarmament. For a number of years she has represented her country in UNO\\u2019s political committee, in which questions of disarmament have been dealt with.During the negotiations in Geneva she played an extremely active role, emerging as the leader of the group of non-aligned nations which endeavoured to bring pressure to bear on the two super powers to show greater concern for concrete disarmament measures. Her experiences from the years spent in Geneva found an outlet in her book \\u201cThe game of disarmament\\u201d, in which she expresses her disappointment at the reluctance of the USA and the USSR to disarm.In her work for disarmament Alva Myrdal has combined profound commitment with great professional insight. With the support of experts she has familiarised herself with the scientific and technical aspects of the arms race. Her understanding of the need to base the work of disarmament on professional insight also found an outlet in her active participation in the establishment of the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, SIPRI. Through her many articles and books Alva Myrdal has exercised a very significant influence on the current disarmament debate.",

        "full-text": "Over 500 years old, the city of Tokyo was once the modest fishing village of Edo (\\u6c5f\\u6238 - literally Gate of the River) due to its location at the mouth of Sumida-gawa. The city only truly began to grow when it became the seat of the Tokugawa Shogunate in 1603, who decided to set up a new seat of power far away from the intrigues of the imperial court in Kyoto. After the Tokugawa Shogunate collapsed in the Meiji Restoration of 1868, the emperor and the imperial family moved here from Kyoto, and the city was renamed to its current name, Tokyo, literally the \\u0022Eastern Capital\\u0022. The metropolitan center of the country, Tokyo is the destination for business, education, modern culture, and government. (That\\u0027s not to say that rivals such as Osaka won\\u0027t dispute those claims.)CultureShinjuku at nightTokyo is vast: it\\u0027s best thought of not as a single city, but a constellation of cities that have grown together. Tokyo\\u0027s districts vary wildly by character, from the electronic blare of Akihabara to the Imperial gardens and shrines of Chiyoda, from the hyperactive youth culture hub of Shibuya to the pottery shops and temple markets of Asakusa. If you don\\u0027t like what you see, hop on the train and head to the next station, and you will find something entirely different.The sheer size and frenetic pace of Tokyo can intimidate the first-time visitor. Much of the city is a jungle of concrete and wires, with a mass of neon and blaring loudspeakers. At rush hour, crowds jostle in packed trains and masses of humanity sweep through enormous and bewilderingly complex stations. Don\\u0027t get too hung up on ticking tourist sights off your list: for most visitors, the biggest part of the Tokyo experience is just wandering around at random and absorbing the vibe, poking your head into shops selling weird and wonderful things, sampling restaurants where you can\\u0027t recognize a single thing on the menu (or on your plate), and finding unexpected oases of calm in the tranquil grounds of a neighbourhood Shinto shrine. It\\u0027s all perfectly safe, and the locals will go to sometimes extraordinary lengths to help you if you just ask.ExpensesCherry blossom picnic at Tamagawadai Park in Ota wardThe cost of living in Tokyo is not as astronomical as it once was. Deflation and market pressures have helped to make costs in Tokyo comparable to most other large cities in the developed world. Visitors from San Francisco, Los Angeles, New York, Chicago, London, Paris, Sydney, Toronto and Dublin will not find it any more expensive than back home. Rent will be significantly cheaper than big Western cities like NYC, London, San Francisco, and Los Angeles. Travelers should budget a similar amount of money for their stay in Tokyo as they would for any other great city in Europe, North America or Australia. Locals will know the bargains, but experienced cheapskates from anywhere in the world can get by with a little ingenuity. Tokyo is one of the most popular places to live in Japan. Rent for a single\\u0027s apartment could range from US$500 to US$1,000 a month. Tokyo is so overwhelmingly crowded that many people live in apartments no bigger than 16 square meters (175 square feet). That being said, with excellent transportation throughout Tokyo and its outskirts, living five minutes further away from central Tokyo could mean hundreds of dollars less for living expenses each month or allow for larger housing. Many parts of Chiba, Saitama, Kanagawa, or even Ibaraki prefectures may allow the feeling of \\u0022living in Tokyo\\u0022. Still, nothing compares to Tokyo itself in regards to waking up and stepping outside instantly into metropolitan life.",

Of course everyone knows the Big Apple, New York City, and it\\u0027s certainly a premier travel destination, but the state is so much more than just one famous metropolis. Go beyond the concrete canyons of Manhattan and you\\u0027ll find a large state with a variety of attractions.From the magnificent Niagara Falls to the farms and wineries of the Finger Lakes; from the untamed wilderness of the Adirondacks to the large and small cities scattered throughout the state \\u2014 every corner of New York has something you can\\u0027t find elsewhere.Nicknamed the Empire State, New York was one of the original thirteen colonies that formed the United States. It has, since the beginning, been among the most populous and influential states.HistoryBefore European settlement, the area now known as New York was already home to a number of Native American tribes. The Iroquois Confederacy (or Haudenosaunee), comprising the Cayuga, Onondaga, Seneca, Mohawk, Oneida, and Tuscarora tribes, was a major early exercise in representative democracy that may have influenced the Founding Fathers of the United States in their own pursuit of constitutional government.European settlement of New York began at New Amsterdam on Manhattan Island. From there, Dutch and then English settlers expanded northward along the Hudson River to present-day Albany, then west along the Mohawk River. Sites in this area of New York were pivotal in the Revolutionary War, especially at Saratoga north of Albany, and New York City served briefly as the nation\\u0027s first capital. White settlement further west was impeded by poor terrain and Indian territories, but by the early 19th century, even those areas were becoming well settled.A true population explosion was brought on by the construction of the Erie Canal from Buffalo to Albany, completed in 1825. Cities like Rochester grew up almost overnight, able to ship their goods easily to points both east and west, and New York City at the mouth of the Hudson became the young country\\u0027s busiest and most important harbor.New York grew and thrived for decades, its cities serving as centers of industry, business, and culture for the entire nation. Even as more and more Western areas opened up and began to be settled, New York remained the Empire State. New York Harbor served as the point of entry for countless immigrants after the Civil War, which contributed to a diverse, energetic population.New York held the title of most populous for over 150 years and has counted numerous important and influential figures among its native sons and daughters. Since the middle of the 20th century, New York\\u0027s influence has waned somewhat as California, Texas, and Florida have swelled in population, but New York remains one of the dominant states in the nation.",

The capital and largest city of the United Kingdom sits on the River Thames in South-East England. Greater London has a population of a little over 9 million. Considered one of the world\\u0027s leading \\u0022global cities\\u0022, London remains an international capital of culture, music, education, fashion, politics, finance and trade. For the visitor, there is a seemingly endless choice of historical sites, shopping, museums, food, art galleries, nightlife, and activities. HistorySettlements have existed on the site of London since well before Roman times, with evidence of Bronze Age and Celtic inhabitants. The Roman city of Londinium, established just after the Roman conquest of Britannia in the year 43, formed the basis for the modern city (some isolated Roman period remains are still to be seen within the City). After the end of Roman rule in 410 and a short-lived decline, London experienced a gradual revival under the Anglo-Saxons, as well as the Norsemen, and emerged as a great medieval trading city, eventually replacing Winchester as the royal capital of England. This paramount status for London was confirmed when William the Conqueror, a Norman, built the Tower of London after the conquest in 1066 and was crowned King of England in Westminster.London went from strength to strength with the rise of England to first European then global prominence, and the city became a great centre of culture, government and industry. London\\u0027s long association with the theatre, for example, can be traced back to the English renaissance (witness the Rose Theatre and great playwrights like Shakespeare who made London their home). With the rise of Britain to supreme maritime power in the 18th and 19th centuries (see Industrial Britain) and the possessor of the largest global empire, London became an imperial capital and drew people and influences from around the world to become, for many years, the largest city in the world.England\\u0027s royal family has, over the centuries, added much to the London scene for today\\u0027s traveller: the Albert Memorial, Buckingham Palace, Kensington Palace, Royal Albert Hall, Tower of London, Kew Palace and Westminster Abbey being prominent examples.Despite the decline of the British Empire, and suffering during the Second World War when London was heavily bombed by the German Luftwaffe in the Blitz, the city remains a top-tier world city: a global centre of culture, finance, and learning. Today London is easily the largest city in the United Kingdom, eight times larger than the second largest, Birmingham, and ten times larger than the third, Glasgow, and dominates the economic, political and social life of the nation. It\\u0027s full of excellent bars, galleries, museums, parks and theatres. It is also the most culturally and ethnically diverse part of the country, and arguably of the whole of Europe as well, making it a great multicultural city to visit. Samuel Johnson famously said, \\u0022when a man is tired of London, he is tired of life\\u0022.

The city is surrounded by nature and national parks, which extend through the suburbs and right to the shores of the harbour. HistoryGiraffes at Taronga Zoo, MosmanWhile originally settled 60,000 years ago, Sydney is the oldest European settlement in Australia, having been established as a British penal colony on 26 January 1788 by Arthur Phillip. This day is now celebrated as Australia Day to mark the establishment of a new nation, although also regarded by many as Invasion Day that marked the beginning of the British appropriation of Aboriginal land. The settlement was named \\u0022Sydney\\u0022 after Thomas Townshend, 1st Viscount Sydney, who was the British Home Secretary at that time.PeopleSydney is one of the most cosmopolitan cities on the planet, with a bit less than one third of its population born overseas. European settlement rapidly displaced the Aboriginal people of the Sydney area with colonists largely coming from England, Ireland and Scotland. The Australian gold rush attracted more immigrants, including a significant number of Chinese, with about one in six Australians with convict descent also having some Chinese ancestry. In the early 20th century, Sydney continued to attract immigrants - mostly from the UK and Ireland, with the White Australia Policy preventing non-European peoples (and even Southern Europeans) from settling. Australia\\u0027s immigration patterns, and consequently, that of Sydney, changed significantly after World War II, when migrants began to arrive from countries as diverse as Italy, Greece, Germany, the Netherlands, China, New Zealand, India, the Philippines, Poland, Lebanon, Iraq, Vietnam, Thailand, South Africa and the Pacific Islands. Sydney\\u0027s culture, food and general outlook well reflect these contributions to the majority Anglo-Celtic institutions and social establishment.Sydney is recognised worldwide for its vibrant LGBT community. Every year, the Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras is celebrated on the first weekend in March, drawing people from all over Australia and the world for the celebrations.Sydney was the centre of the world\\u0027s attention in September 2000 when the city hosted the Summer Olympics - announced by the IOC Chairman at the closing ceremony to be \\u0022the best games ever\\u0022.

It\\u0027s the famed city of the Roman Empire, the Seven Hills, La Dolce Vita, the Vatican City and Three Coins in the Fountain. Rome, as a millennia-long centre of power, culture and religion, was the centre of one of the greatest civilisations ever, and has exerted a huge influence over the world in its circa 2500 years of existence.The ColosseumThe historic centre of the city is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. With wonderful palaces, thousand-year-old churches and basilicas, grand romantic ruins, opulent monuments, ornate statues and graceful fountains, Rome has an immensely rich historical heritage and cosmopolitan atmosphere, making it one of Europe\\u0027s and the world\\u0027s most visited, famous, influential and beautiful capitals. Today, Rome has a growing nightlife scene and is also seen as a shopping heaven, being regarded as one of the fashion capitals of the world; some of Italy\\u0027s oldest jewellery and clothing establishments were founded in the city. With so many sights and things to do, Rome can truly be classified a \\u0022global city\\u0022. Situated on the River Tiber, between the Apennine Mountains and the Tyrrhenian Sea, the \\u0022Eternal City\\u0022 was once the administrative centre of the mighty Roman Empire, governing a vast region that stretched all the way from Britain to Mesopotamia. Today it remains the seat of the Italian government and home to numerous ministerial offices. Rome has 2.7 million inhabitants while the metropolitan area is home to around 4.5 million.Architecturally and culturally, Rome has some contrasts - you have areas with pompously huge majestic palaces, avenues and basilicas, which are then surrounded by tiny alleyways, little churches and old houses.

It is also the 19th largest city in the world, and among the world\\u0027s most densely populated cities.On the Nile river, Cairo is famous for its own history, preserved in the fabulous medieval Islamic city and Coptic sites in Old Cairo \\u2014 with historic Cairo inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage list. The Egyptian Museum in the city centre is a must see, with its countless Ancient Egyptian artefacts, as is shopping at the Khan al-Khalili bazaar. No trip to Cairo would be complete without a visit to the Giza Pyramids and to the nearby Saqqara Pyramid Complex, where visitors will see Egypt\\u0027s first step pyramid built by the architect Imhotep for the third dynasty pharaoh Djoser.Though firmly attached to the past, Cairo is also home to a vibrant modern society. The Midan Tahrir area situated in downtown Cairo, built in the 19th century under the rule of Khedive Ismail, has strived to be a \\u0022Paris on the Nile\\u0022. There also are a number of more modern suburbs including Ma\\u0027adi and Heliopolis, while Zamalek is a quiet area on Gezira Island, with upmarket shopping. Cairo is best in the fall or spring, when the weather isn\\u0027t so hot. A felucca ride on the Nile is a good way to escape from the busy city, as is a visit to Al-Azhar Park.Since the revolution in 2011 and the counter-revolution, tourists fled Cairo to a large extent. But by the end of the 2010s, they were returning, however tourism had not recovered fully, so you have an opportunity to see sites like the pyramids with smaller crowds. Cairo is on the Nile, and has ancient origins in the vicinity of the Pharaonic city of Memphis. The city started to take its present form in 641 CE, when the Arab general Amr Ibn Al-Ase conquered Egypt for Islam and founded a new capital called Misr Al-Fustat, \\u0022the City of the Tents\\u0022. The legend is that Al-Ase, on the day he was leaving to conquer Alexandria, found two doves nesting in his tent. Not wanting to disturb them, he left the tent. Upon returning victorious, he called his soldiers to pitch their tents around his, and this became the site of the new city in what is now Old Cairo. The name may have been a pun \\u2013 Misr/Masr is the Arabic word for city, but it is also the Arabic name of the entire country of Egypt. The Tunisian Fatimid dynasty captured the city in 969 CE and founded a new city, Al-Qahira (\\u0022The Victorious\\u0022) just north of Al-Fustat. Al-Qahira gave the city its English name, Cairo, but the locals still call it M\\u00e0Sr (\\u0645\\u0635\\u0631), which is also the Arabic name of the entire country of Egypt (similar to Mexico City in Mexico).",

The city is one of the ten most popular tourist destinations in the world. The city is also considered one of the most modern and progressive cities in the Middle East \\u2013 certainly in the Arab world \\u2013 and is also sometimes nicknamed as \\u0022City of Gold\\u0022 due to historically being a hub for gold trade as well as the rapid transformation from a desert into a luxurious city.Dubai is characterized by a vast landscape of desert which transforms into a futuristic style of skyscrapers along the coastline. The city offers both insights into the old merchant and pearl diving history of the Arabs in Deira and Bur Dubai and the new modern skyscraper business and bustling life in Jumeirah and Jebel Ali. Dubai is sometimes mistakenly thought of as a country, but it is actually one of the emirates that make up the United Arab Emirates. It is the financial centre of the United Arab Emirates.Dubai is also considered a commercial and cultural hub of the Middle East, it\\u0027s a global transport hub, and has attracted world attention through many large innovative construction projects and sports events. The city is symbolised by its skyscrapers, including the world\\u0027s tallest building, Burj Khalifa, in addition to ambitious development projects including man-made islands, world-class luxury hotels, and some of the largest and extraordinarily modern shopping malls in the world.HistoryDubai began as a small fishing village on the coast of the eastern Arabian Peninsula. At the beginning, the town made its income as a small pearl diving town. However, as expanding trade boomed across the gulf, it became a trading hub between Iran and India and gained a lot of notoriety for its imported goods from the East. In fact, the currency of Dubai used to be the Indian rupee historically. It was also used as a smuggling town to smuggle gold from Africa and elsewhere and import it to India, this made Dubai a well-known point in the map for various traders. When oil companies looked for oil around the Trucial States, Dubai was shown to not have any significant oil reserves compared to Abu Dhabi. Sheikh Rashid Al Maktoum, then the leader and Sheikh of Dubai, continued on the booming expansion of trade in Dubai instead of relying on any oil income. He welcomed Indian traders, Iranian traders, and even Western officials and travelers to his hometown. The open policy of commerce and tolerance of foreigners made Dubai a willing destination for any non-Arab or non-Muslim, in stark contrast to other cities in the Arabian peninsula which viewed non-Muslims with suspicion. Sheikh Rashid\\u0027s son, Sheikh Mohammed, had a vision of establishing Dubai as a Middle Eastern tourist destination. In his memoir, when he met with other GCC heads of state after the British withdrawal from the gulf and proposed on making Dubai a tourist destination, the rest of the Sheikhs laughed at him. They told him nobody would like to come and visit a barren desert. Nevertheless, Sheikh Mohammed made the effort to hire experts and change the entire infrastructure of the city to welcome tourists, established free-zones with no taxes, invested in major tourism projects and opened the city for everyone regardless of race or religion. Multiple Western companies and institutions, wanting to expand their influence in the Middle East, welcomed Dubai\\u0027s tax-free open-arm invitation. Dubai was seen as the only city in the Arabian peninsula that would allow non-Muslims to live, drink, and enjoy their lives by their own laws and Western or non-Islamic standards, though it is now rivalled by nearby Doha and Abu Dhabi in this regard.",

August is probably the busiest time for tourists in Barcelona. However, many shops and restaurants are closed from early-August to early September.

Situated on either side of the Bosphorus, Istanbul retains its metropolitan status: the city\\u0027s population is more than 14 million people, making it one of the largest cities in the world.Lauded in antiquity as \\u0022the second Rome\\u0022, this is a city where you most certainly should roam \\u2014 culture and excitement lie around every corner and more than 2,000 years of history await you. While relics of prehistoric human settlement were found in the Yar\\u0131mburgaz Cave near the K\\u00fc\\u00e7\\u00fck\\u00e7ekmece Lake and during the construction of a subway station in Yenikap\\u0131, Greek colonists from Megara, directed by their legendary leader Byzas, have been traditionally accepted as the founders of Istanbul. Expanding the ancient Greek colony of Byzantium by the order of the Roman Emperor Constantine the Great, the imperial city of Constantinople was for nearly a thousand years the heavily-fortified capital of the Eastern Roman (later termed Byzantine) Empire. To this day, the Ecumenical Patriarch, head of the Eastern Orthodox Church continues to be the Archbishop of Constantinople, who is still based in Istanbul. It was finally conquered by the Ottoman Sultan Mehmed II on 29 May 1453, an event sometimes used to mark the end of the Middle Ages. It was the nerve centre for military campaigns that were to enlarge the Ottoman Empire dramatically. By the mid-1500s, Istanbul, with a population of almost half a million, was a major cultural, political, and commercial centre. Ottoman rule continued until it was defeated in the first World War and Istanbul was occupied by the allies. When the Republic of Turkey was born in 1923 after the War of Independence, Kemal Atat\\u00fcrk moved its capital to the city of Ankara, strategically located in the centre of the new republic. However, Istanbul has continued to expand dramatically; today its population is approximately 14 million and increases at an estimated 400,000 immigrants per year. Industry has expanded even as tourism has grown. It continues to be a city that creates its own history at the intersection where both continents meet.",
        "ft_llama_summary": "Istanbul, formerly known as Byzantium and Constantinople, is a large city rich in history and culture. It is the financial and cultural center of Turkey, straddling Asia and Europe. Founded by Greek colonists, it was the capital of the Eastern Roman Empire and later the Ottoman Empire, and is now home to over 14 million people.",

        "full-text": "Amsterdam is the capital of the Netherlands. It is known for the canals that cross the city, its impressive architecture, museums and art galleries, its notorious red light district, and more than 1,500 bridges.The city has earned the title of Venice of the North for a good reason: few other cities have intricate web of canals, exquisite architecture, and a staggering collection of over 1500 bridges weave an undeniable charm. Whether you\\u0027re here for the rich cultural heritage, the vibrant nightlife, or the serene alleyways, Amsterdam\\u0027s magnetic pull is universal.Although once an innocuous and humble fishing village during the late 12th century, Amsterdam catapulted into global prominence during the 17th century as a bustling trading hub. The city\\u0027s evolution birthed iconic districts like Jordaan and the Canal Belt, the latter earning UNESCO World Heritage status in 2010. The 19th and 20th centuries ushered in expansion, punctuated by modernist districts. With a population surpassing 920,000 in 2022 \\u2013 and soaring well past a million when you account for the immediate surroundings \\u2013 Amsterdam unquestionably holds the crown as the Netherlands\\u0027 largest city. Numbers aside, Amsterdam is the financial, cultural, and creative heart of the nation.OrientationCorner of Keizersgracht and ReguliersgrachtThe \\u0022Amsterdam\\u0022 that most visitors experience is the city centre, the semi-circle with Centraal Station at its apex. It corresponds to the city as it was around 1850. Five major concentric canals ring the Binnenstad: Singel, Herengracht, Keizersgracht, Prinsengracht and Singelgracht, together forming the Canal District. Other districts inside the city centre are the Jordaan, a former working class area now popular with yuppies, and Plantage, a leafy and spacious area with botanical gardens and the zoo. The Nassaukade, Stadhouderskade and Mauritskade surround the city centre and mark the location of the former city moat and fortifications. Almost everything outside this line was built after 1870.The semi-circle is on the south side of the IJ, which is often called a river but more exactly is an estuary. Going east from Centraal Station, the railway passes the artificial islands of the redeveloped Eastern Docklands. North of the IJ is mainly housing, although a major dockland redevelopment has started there too.The river Amstel flows into the city from the south. Originally, it flowed along the line Rokin-Damrak. The dam in the Amstel, which gives the city its name, was located under the present Bijenkorf department store near Dam Square. The original settlement was on the right bank of the Amstel, on the present Warmoesstraat: it is therefore the oldest street in the city. The city has expanded in all directions, except to the northeast of the A10 ring motorway. That area is a protected rural landscape of open fields and small villages considered a part of the Waterland region.The radius of the semi-circle is about 2 km. All major tourist destinations, and most hotels, are located inside it or just outside it. As a result, a large swathe of Amsterdam is not visited by the average tourist: at least 90% of the population lives outside this area. Most economic activity in Amsterdam\\u2014the offices of the financial sector, the port\\u2014is near or outside the ring motorway, which is 4\\u20135 km from the centre.The expansion of Amsterdam outside the ring motorway and the expansion of activity outside the city centre is redefining what locals consider the \\u0027central area\\u0027 of Amsterdam. Zuid, especially with the construction of the Noord/Zuidlijn and the Zuidas, is becoming more and more important in the daily lives of the locals. Its significance for tourists has increased by the now completed reconstruction work on the Museumplein and the adjoining museums.",

        "full-text": "Athens (Greek: \\u0391\\u03b8\\u03ae\\u03bd\\u03b1, Ath\\u00edna), is the capital city of Greece with a metropolitan population of 3.7 million inhabitants (2020). It is in many ways the birthplace of Classical Greece, and therefore of Western civilization. It is a place where modern Greek culture business and social life flourishes amidst ancient monuments. Athens has turned into a large and bustling city, but as a result it also suffers from congestion, pollution, and poverty.According to mythology, the Greek Gods Poseidon and Athena wanted to claim the city for their own. To persuade the people to accept them, they granted gifts. Poseidon struck his spear into the ground and produced running water. Athena gave the city olive trees - which provide food and economic prosperity through trade. The people were then asked to vote for the Gods, and Athena won by a single vote - resulting in the city bearing her name.The first pre-historic settlements were constructed in 3000 BC around the hill of Acropolis. According to legend the King of Athens, Theseus, unified the ten tribes of early Athens into one kingdom in around 1230 BC. This process of synoikismos \\u2013 bringing together in one home \\u2013 created the largest and wealthiest state on the Greek mainland, but it also created a larger class of people excluded from political life by the nobility.By the 7th century BCE, social unrest had become widespread, and the Areopagus appointed Draco to draft a strict new law code (hence \\u0022draconian\\u0022). Still, the Draconian laws were a big advancement, as they codified crime and punishment unlike the previous arbitrary judgments of the rulers. When Draco\\u0027s system failed, they appointed Solon, with a mandate to create a new constitution (594). This was the great beginning of a new social revolution, which was the result of the democracy under Cleisthenes (508). When Roman historians wrote the history of their own republic, they fudged the date so that their republic would be older than Athenian democracy, but today\\u0027s scholarly consensus is that Rome \\u0022got inspiration\\u0022 from the Greeks.Evzones marching, Tomb of the Unknown SoldierIn the 5th century BCE, Athens reached the peak of its fame. It was the most powerful Greek city-state, and the center of Greek cultural life, hosting perhaps the greatest cultural advances in all of human history. Fields of study like science, philosophy, history, and medicine were developed for the first time by Athenian scholars in the timeframe between 480 (the battle of Salamis) and 343 (when Aristotle went to Macedonia to assume teaching duties to Alexander the royal heir), known as Athens\\u0027 \\u0022golden age\\u0022 - although political dominance came to an end after the Peloponnesian War (431-404), most famous because of its History written by the Athenian general and scholar Thucydides, the \\u0022Father of Scientific History\\u0022.Later on, Athens became part of the Macedonian empire under Alexander, and still later part of the Roman Empire. While it was no longer politically significant, its intellectual reputation gave it a special status, until, in the year 529, Emperor Justinian issued an edict imposing a perpetual silence on all its schools, and the empire\\u0027s intellectual center moved to Constantinople.Athens was thriving and prosperous during the Crusades, actually benefiting from the Italian trade during this period. However, this fruitful period was short-lived, as Greece suffered badly under the Ottoman Empire, only to recover in the 19th century as the capital of independent Greece. In modern times, the Athens urban area has grown to a population of 3.7 million.",

With 545,000 residents in the city and 2.9 million in the Lisbon Region (2021) and a thriving mix of Portugal\\u0027s rich history and vivid contemporary culture, Lisbon enchants travellers with its white bleached limestone buildings, intimate alleyways, and an easy going charm that makes it a popular year round destination.Greater Lisbon comprises many other splendid tourist destinations such as the  UNESCO World Heritage Site of Sintra, the seaside resorts of Estoril, Cascais, the world class museums, or Almada famous for its hilltop Cristo Rei statue, all of which are connected with Lisbon by excellent public transportation links. Lisbon is built on seven hills, so getting around Lisbon can be a workout. Many slopes and few really flat areas is one of Lisbon\\u0027s trademarks. This is also a city of enchanting contrasts: The elegant squares, broad avenues, monumental buildings and rectangular layout of the lower areas quickly gives way to the hilly, narrow, winding, unpredictable and cramped streets of districts such as Alfama and Bairro Alto. The elegant dining rooms and smart rooftop bars of expensive hotels seems like a different world compared to the excellent restaurants disguised behind an inconspicuous fa\\u00e7ade in a modest Bairro Alto street. Quality patisseries and restaurants thrive side by side with late night bars and noisy discos. The old, tiny squeaky trams (one of the city\\u0027s trademarks) are no less of a contrast to the efficient metro network.The Portuguese capital is often perceived as less frantic than other million cities, and traffic and barkers are less aggressive than in many other tourist destinations. HistoryThe Castle of S\\u00e3o Jorge, constructed in the 10th century, crowns the historical Alfama district.According to legend, Lisbon was founded by the mythical Greek hero Odysseus, during his travels home from Troy. However, most historians believe that the city was founded around 1200 BC by Phoenician settlers, utilizing the calm and fresh waters of Tagus river and the proximity to the sea. The Phoenician name of the city is Alis-Ubo, meaning \\u0022safe harbour\\u0022. Eventually it became part of the Carthaginian Empire. After the Punic Wars, it became the main trading hub of the Roman province Lusitania, under the name Felicitas Julia Olisipo, later Olisipona. During the decline and fall of the western Roman Empire, the Iberian peninsula was invaded by Vandal and Visigothic tribes.In 711, Lisbon was captured by Muslim forces. During this period, the Castle of S\\u00e3o Jorge was expanded. Much of the Moorish heritage is preserved in the nearby Alfama, the oldest standing district of the city. In 1147, a Crusader army en route to the Holy Land helped King Afonso I conquer Lisbon and return it to Christian rule. After the completion of the Portuguese Reconquista some hundred years later, Lisbon was made the capital of Portugal.",

Blessed with miles of coastline, lush vegetation and crowned by the North Shore Mountains, it\\u0027s hard to be there and not stop at some point and be amazed by what you see.But scratch beneath that setting and you find a cosmopolitan city of many faces. It is a mix of old and new, a stopping place for immigrants that have infused the city\\u0027s neighbourhoods, festivals and food. On one hand, Greater Vancouver is the third largest metropolitan area in Canada, the second biggest destination for visitors to the country and the economic hub of British Columbia. A modern city of glass towers with a variety of festivals, cultures and attractions, it has also been host to world events like the 1986 World Exposition and the 2010 Winter Olympics. To others, it\\u0027s Vansterdam, the laid-back socially progressive city with the laissez-faire attitude to marijuana. With its Asian heritage and relative proximity to China and Japan, some see it as the gateway to Asia; often called Hongcouver due to the large number of immigrants and political refugees from Hong Kong living in the area. And with all that nature minutes from your door, Vancouver is a haven for outdoor enthusiasts. It\\u0027s one of those rare places you could ski in the mountains, hit one of the many sandy beaches and play a round of golf all in the same day. Vancouver is one of the most culturally diverse and cosmopolitan cities in the world, with just under half its residents born outside Canada.All of this makes it easy to be a local. Walk the Seawall. Spend a day in one of the parks. Indulge in food and treats from around the world at a neighbourhood restaurant. Or just grab a spot at the beach or on a patio and watch it all go by \\u2013 Vancouver is, after all, one of the most beautiful spots in the world. While Vancouver is a comparatively young city, founded in 1867, its history begins long before. The Coast Salish indigenous peoples (First Nations) have lived in the area for at least 6,000 years. The present city\\u0027s namesake Captain George Vancouver sailed through the First Narrows on 13 June 1792, naming Burrard Inlet after his friend Sir Harry Burrard. The first settlement on the downtown peninsula was Granville, on the spot of today\\u0027s Gastown. In 1867, the year of Canada\\u0027s confederation, a saloon was built on this site and gave birth to a small shantytown of bars and stores, adjacent to the original mill, on the south shore of what is now the city\\u0027s harbour. A seemingly endless supply of high-quality lumber was logged and sold through the ports of Gastown and Moodyville, across the inlet. Some of the trees were gigantic beams which were shipped to China to construct Beijing\\u0027s Imperial Palace. One account maintains that the world\\u0027s windjammer fleets could not have been built without the trees of Burrard Inlet.Vancouver\\u0027s first City Hall was little more than a hand-painted sign nailed to a wooden tent post. The arrival of the transcontinental railway, a few years later, spurred growth even more, and by 1892 the area had over 20,000 residents. 18 years later, this figure was over 100,000.Factor in constant growth every year since (many in the double digits), and Greater Vancouver today is Canada\\u0027s largest metropolitan area west of Toronto by far, with more than 2,600,000 residents, more than half of British Columbia\\u0027s population as a whole. It is also the fastest growing part of Canada. During the 1980s and 1990s, Vancouver received a large number of immigrants from Hong Kong fleeing the impending handover to China. Greater Vancouver is today one of the most ethnically diverse metropolitan areas in the world, home to the second largest Chinese population in North America after the San Francisco Bay Area, and with about half its population being born outside Canada. It is also home to a large and influential Sikh community, and one of the main centres of the Khalistan movement that advocates for the carving out of an independent Sikh nation from India.For many, Vancouver truly \\u0022arrived\\u0022 in 1986, when the city hosted the Expo 86 World\\u0027s Fair. Media attention from around the world was consistently positive, though many saw the resulting gentrification of poorer areas as being harmful to Vancouver\\u0027s lower-class citizens, as many residents of the Downtown Eastside were evicted from their homes. Vancouver also hosted the 2010 Winter Olympics, which was largely seen as another success, though it brought some similar criticisms.Vancouver is perhaps best known for its scenic beauty, and the opportunities afforded by its natural environment. Vancouver is one of those rare places where you could theoretically ski in the mountains, windsurf in the ocean, and play a round of golf all in the same day. Surrounded by water on three sides, and crowned by the North Shore mountains, Vancouver is a great destination, and a great starting point for discovering the area\\u0027s many outdoor activities.Vancouver is a major sea port on the Pacific Ocean, and a base for many Alaska cruise ships in the summer. It has the same name as another city in the region, Vancouver, Washington (USA).Vancouver is believed to be the inspiration for the fictional setting of Adventure Bay, in the animated children\\u0027s television series PAW Patrol.Vancouver\\u0027s residents enjoy a high standard of living, and the city is consistently ranked among the most livable on Earth.",
