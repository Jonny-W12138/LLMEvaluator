A \"key fact\" is a single fact written as briefly and clearly as possible, encompassing at most 2-3 entities. \nHere are nine examples of key facts to illustrate the desired level of granularity:\n* Kevin Carr set off on his journey from Haytor.\n* Kevin Carr set off on his journey from Dartmoor.\n* Kevin Carr set off on his journey in July 2013.\n* Kevin Carr is less than 24 hours away from completing his trip.\n* Kevin Carr ran around the world unsupported.\n* Kevin Carr ran with his tent.\n* Kevin Carr is set to break the previous record.\n* Kevin Carr is set to break the record by 24 hours.\n* The previous record was held by an Australian.\nInstruction:\nFirst, read the summary carefully. Second, decompose the summary into (at most 16) key facts. Provide your answer in JSON format. The answer should be a dictionary with the key\"key facts\" containing the key facts as a list:\n{\"key facts\": [\"first key fact\", \"second key fact\", \"third key fact\"]}\nSummary:\n{{summary}}\n",
