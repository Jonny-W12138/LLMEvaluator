        "context": "News I\n\nYelp To Show Reviews It Automatically Filters\n\nApril 6, 2010 / 2:01 AM EDT / CBS/AP\n\nYelp, seeking to combat allegations that the online reviews site manipulates its users' feedback on local businesses, will now let visitors see the items that had been automatically removed by software meant to catch unreliable content.\n\n\n\nStarting late Monday, Yelp is adding links to take visitors to those once-hidden reviews - a change that gives businesses and individuals a rare peek at decisions rendered by the popular startup's software.\n\n\n\nAlthough the site won't detail why each review has been shunned from a company's Yelp page, which shows information such as its hours and location along with photos and reviews, readers may be able to draw their own conclusions after seeing the hidden content.\n\n\n\nYelp CEO and co-founder Jeremy Stoppelman said Monday that the company wants to make people understand that Yelp does give all businesses fair treatment, despite allegations that advertisers are favored.\n\n\n\n\"You'll be able to dive into the content yourself and make your own judgment,\" he said.\n\n\n\nOther Coverage\n\n\n\nYelp CEO on Policy Shift\n\nLA Times\n\nTechCrunch\n\nhttp://gigaom.com/2010/04/05/yelp-changes-features-to-address-extortion-claims\" class=\"linkIcon read\">GigaOm\n\n\n\nSince it started letting consumers post reviews six years ago, Yelp has used an automated program to weigh reviews and sift out those that are potentially unreliable, such as a negative review that a pizzeria owner might write about a competitor.\n\n\n\nStill, business owners have long complained about the way positive and negative reviews can come and go from their pages on Yelp. At least three lawsuits seeking class-action status have been filed against the site by a dozen small companies alleging that reviews are manipulated depending on whether a company advertises on the site. The businesses claim they've been pressured to advertise on the site in exchange for getting negative reviews squashed.\n\n\n\nYelp, based in San Francisco, says it doesn't manipulate reviews aside from letting advertisers choose one review that they want to feature at the top of their page. Although such featured reviews have been clearly marked as such, the company is getting rid of it entirely. It will be replaced in the next few weeks by a feature that lets advertisers post a video to their Yelp \n\nNews II\n\nYelp To Alert Consumers On Fake Reviews\n\nSanfrancisco October 18, 2012 / 5:43 PM PDT / CBS San Francisco\n\n\n\n\n\nSAN FRANCISCO (CBS/AP) - Yelp says it will alert users if it suspects that a business has tried to buy fake, misleading reviews on its site.\n\n\n\nYelp Inc. said Thursday that some businesses go to \"extreme lengths\" to boost positive reviews. This includes paying people to write them.\n\n\n\nWhile Yelp already filters suspected fake reviews, the alerts will add an extra layer of scrutiny. San Francisco-based Yelp said alerts will stay on a business' page for 90 days after it's placed there. If Yelp finds ongoing efforts to post fake reviews, the alert will remain longer.\n\n\n\nConsumers can click on the alert to see more details on the misleading reviews, including screenshots.\n\n\n\nYelp has more than 78 million monthly visitors.\n\n\n\n(Copyright 2012 by CBS San Francisco.

Yet it still refuses to investigate reviews accused of being inaccurate or permit businesses to respond to reviews on the site. Instead, the company operates on the premise that reviewers tend to be truthful and that greater accuracy will emerge from more reviews.\n\nGrace Malki, a college student who lives in Berkeley, Calif., said she appreciated that philosophy. “Yelp is about being honest and giving people the real story,” said Ms. Malki, who has written 92 reviews and checks Yelp before trying restaurants or dance clubs. Millions of other people agree  Yelp had seven million visitors in December, up from 2.8 million a year earlier, according to comScore.\n\nBut as the company tries to expand beyond its current 24 cities, maintain its lead over rivals and become profitable, it is beginning to realize that it needs to build trust with businesses, too  especially since their ads provide almost all of the company’s revenue.\n\nYelp “can’t neglect the needs of businesses, nor can they be a site where businesses can be abused,” said Peter Fenton, who is on Yelp’s board and is a partner at Benchmark Capital, which invested $10 million in the company.\n\nIn April, the site added Yelp for Business Owners, which allows businesses to edit their company profiles, post special offers and privately e-mail reviewers.\n\nJeremy Stoppelman, Yelp’s co-founder and chief executive, is blogging more often about how Yelp works and just started a Twitter account to communicate with business owners and reviewers. Yelp is also planning conversations at chambers of commerce and local restaurant associations.\n\n\n\nThere is no question that thousands of small businesses have benefited from the increased exposure they receive through the service. Amid a sea of competing pizza joints, dry cleaners and furniture stores, those with good Yelp reviews win more business. Foot traffic to Foamorder, a mattress vendor in San Francisco, increased 50 percent because of positive reviews, said its owner, Michael Gorham.\n\nBut Mr. Stoppelman said those steps are not enough for many firms. “Business owners want to control their reputation, and we’re just not going to let that happen,” he said. His top priority is “to make sure the community is protected and can share without fear of being publicly spat on.”\n\nA one-star review of Tart, a Los Angeles restaurant, illustrates the impasse. “The turkey meatloaf was gritty and cold and I waited 45 minutes for my second $28 margarita,” one reviewer wrote in January. The restaurant’s owner, Peter Picataggio, complained to Yelp that he does not serve turkey meatloaf and the most expensive margarita on the menu is $25.\n\n\n\nJeremy Stoppelman, chief executive of Yelp, says the company cannot referee factual disputes between businesses and reviewers.Credit...Jim Wilson/The New York Times\n\nHe asked Yelp to remove the review, and although he advertises on the site, the company refused. “If they’re going to take my money, I think the onus is on them, not on the business, to go and prove whether it’s true or false,” he said.\n\n“We can’t referee factual disputes,” responded Mr. Stoppelman. “Why believe the business owner who has skin in the game?”\n\nOther businesses simply want the ability to publicly respond to reviews, the way other review sites, such as the travel site TripAdvisor, allow businesses to do.\n\nPK Art and Floral Design in San Francisco has a one-star review that accuses it of overcharging for a wedding bouquet. Pam Unkai, the owner, said the customer had requested expensive additions to her arrangements. When she complained to Yelp, the company told her to take it up with the reviewer by e-mail. “I wanted to respond on my page, so I know that everybody has the ability to judge by themselves,” Ms. Unkai said.\n\nYelp’s formula for determining which reviews appear on the site is also cloaked in mystery, some businesses say.\n\nFawn Pierre has a new puppy training business in San Francisco. About a quarter of her customers come from Yelp, she said, so she was concerned when three of her five-star reviews disappeared recently. When she contacted Yelp, the company referred her to a page on the Web site that said “reviews normally come and go from a business’s page.”\n\nMr. Stoppelman said Yelp’s spam filter scans for fishy reviews, such as those that seem to have been written by a malicious competitor or a business owner’s friend. He acknowledged, though, that the filter is overly vigilant, in some cases removing legitimate reviews.\n\nMs. Pierre said the missing reviews were written by unbiased, paying customers. “Here I am, a person with only five-star reviews, and I’m upset  there’s something going on here,” she said. “It makes me wonder: Do people who pay get a better deal; do their reviews stay up longer?”\n\nFrustration with Yelp is most apparent in the San Francisco Bay Area, where the service began and where it has the power to make or break a restaurant or small shop. Two California doctors recently sued Yelp reviewers, claiming they had written false reviews.\n\nLocal news outlets have raised questions about the company’s practices, including a recent article in the East Bay Express, an alternative weekly, with the provocative headline: “Yelp and the Business of Extortion 2.0.” It reported that Yelp sales representatives had promised to move or remove negative reviews for advertisers.\n\nMr. Stoppelman said that Yelp does not move negative reviews for advertisers and applies the same ranking system to all companies on the site. Many advertisers, including Mr. Picataggio of Tart restaurant, have negative reviews.\n\nSome of the confusion may come from the fact that advertisers, who pay $300 to $1,000 a month, are allowed to choose which review shows up at the top of their profile page and block ads from competitors. For other businesses, the first two listings a reader sees could be an ad for a competitor and a one-star review.\n\nBut from a profit standpoint, the moral hazard of yelp and advertisers colluding to control reviews cannot be underestimated. A Business reputation is their lifeline. Several lawsuits have been filed alleging Yelp hurts small businesses, filtering good reviews and posting bad ones.\n\n“If there’s no clarity about that process at all, it exacerbates the suspicion,” said Eric Goldman, a professor at Santa Clara University School of Law and the former general counsel of Epinions, another review site.\n\nYelp’s lack of transparency does not affect its relationship with businesses alone. It also risks eroding users’ trust in the site. Eric Kingery, an engineer and frequent Yelp user in Chicago, discovered that a review he had written of a jeweler disappeared. “It just makes me suspicious of the impartiality,” he said. “It is a very useful service, but this kind of harms the integrity of the site.”\n\n\n\nConsumer Review Fairness Act: What Businesses Need to Know\n\nTags:\n\n \n\nAdvertising and Marketing\n\n \n\nEndorsements, Influencers, and Reviews\n\n \n\nOnline Advertising and Marketing\n\n \n\nAdvertising and Marketing Basics\n\nThe Consumer Review Fairness Act (CRFA) protects people’s ability to share their honest opinions about a business’s products, services, or conduct, in any forum, including social media. Is your company complying?\n\nContracts that prohibit honest reviews, or threaten legal action over them, harm people who rely on reviews when making their purchase decisions. But another group is also harmed when others try to squelch honest negative reviews: businesses that work hard to earn positive reviews.\n\nThe Consumer Review Fairness Act was passed in response to reports that some businesses try to prevent people from giving honest reviews about products or services they received. Some companies put contract provisions in place, including in their online terms and conditions, that allowed them to sue or penalize consumers for posting negative reviews.\n\nHere are some basic tips for complying with the law.\n\nWhat kind of reviews does the law protect?\n\nThe law protects a broad variety of honest consumer assessments, including online reviews, social media posts, uploaded photos, videos, etc. And it doesn’t just cover product reviews. It also applies to consumer evaluations of a company’s customer service.\n\nWhat does the Consumer Review Fairness Act prohibit?\n\nIn summary, the Act makes it illegal for a company to use a contract provision that:\n\nbars or restricts the ability of a person who is a party to that contract to review a company’s products, services, or conduct;\n\nimposes a penalty or fee against someone who gives a review; or\n\nrequires people to give up their intellectual property rights in the content of their reviews.\n\nWhat specific conduct is prohibited by the statute? \n\nThe Consumer Review Fairness Act makes it illegal for companies to include standardized provisions that threaten or penalize people for posting honest reviews. For example, in an online transaction, it would be illegal for a company to include a provision in its terms and conditions that prohibits or punishes negative reviews by customers. (The law doesn’t apply to employment contracts or agreements with independent contractors, however.)\n\nWhat can a company do to protect itself from inappropriate or irrelevant content?\n\nThe law says it’s OK to prohibit or remove a review that:\n\ncontains confidential or private information – for example, a person’s financial, medical, or personnel file information or a company’s trade secrets;\n\nis libelous, harassing, abusive, obscene, vulgar, sexually explicit, or is inappropriate with respect to race, gender, sexuality, ethnicity, or other intrinsic characteristic;\n\nis unrelated to the company’s products or services; or\n\nis clearly false or misleading.\n\nHowever, it’s unlikely that a consumer’s assessment or opinion with which you disagree meets the “clearly false or misleading” standard.\n\nWhat’s the penalty for violating the Consumer Review Fairness Act? \n\nCongress gave enforcement authority to the Federal Trade Commission and the state Attorneys General. The law specifies that a violation of the CRFA will be treated the same as violating an FTC rule defining an unfair or deceptive act or practice. This means that your company could be subject to financial penalties, as well as a federal court order.\n\nTo make sure your company is complying with the Consumer Review Fairness Act:\n\nReview your form contracts, including online terms and conditions; and\n\nRemove any provision that restricts people from sharing their honest reviews, penalizes those who do, or claims copyright over peoples’ reviews (even if you’ve never tried to enforce it or have no intention of enforcing it).\n\nThe wisest policy: Let people speak honestly about your products and their experience with your company.\n\nOpportunity to Comment\n\nThe National Small Business Ombudsman and 10 Regional Fairness Boards collect comments from small businesses about federal compliance and enforcement activities. Each year, the Ombudsman evaluates the conduct of these activities and rates each agency's responsiveness to small businesses. Small businesses can comment to the Ombudsman without fear of reprisal. To comment, call toll-free 1-888-REGFAIR (1-888-734-3247) or go to www.sba.gov/ombudsman.\n\nFebruary 2017\n\n\n\nYelp Reviews: What is it and How it Works\n\nYelp is an influential online review network, and one of its most important components is the reviews left by users. The concept is relatively straightforward yet immensely impactful. Users, typically customers who have patronized various businesses, contribute by providing comprehensive reviews and star ratings. These star ratings range from one to five, with one indicating a subpar experience and five indicating excellence. The accompanying written evaluations provide users with the opportunity to provide a detailed account of their experiences with a specific business, service, or product. These narratives may contain a multitude of details, such as service quality, product satisfaction, ambiance, pricing, and other factors.\n\nThe functionality of Yelp Reviews is predicated on a symbiotic relationship between consumers and businesses. They serve as a valuable resource for consumers to make informed decisions. Prospective customers use these evaluations to gain insight into a business’s reputation and performance, allowing them to choose establishments that meet their preferences and expectations. On the other hand, businesses use these evaluations as customer feedback and engagement. They gauge consumer satisfaction, address concerns, and cultivate client relationships by monitoring and responding to reviews. The bidirectional exchange of information promotes market transparency and accountability.\n\nYelp employs a variety of algorithms and criteria to curate and rank reviews on its platform. The relevance of the review, the user’s reviewing history, and the overall dependability of the user’s contributions all play a role in determining which reviews are highlighted. The strategy is intended to highlight reviews that the Yelp community deems reliable and valuable.\n\nWhat is a Yelp Review?\n\nYelp is a web-based review platform that enables users to provide star ratings and write comprehensive reviews for businesses. A user-created assessment of a company, product, or service published on the Yelp platform is called a Yelp review.\n\nIt usually consists of a star rating (one to five stars) and a written commentary elaborating on the reviewer’s personal experiences, opinions, and comments regarding their involvement with the company. Other potential customers use these evaluations as a resource to determine the quality and reputation of a company, and businesses use them to gather feedback and communicate with their customer base.\n\nWhat is the purpose of Yelp Reviews?\n\nThe purpose of Yelp Reviews is to give customers a forum in which they get to discuss the experiences they’ve had with various businesses, as well as the goods and services they’ve purchased and used.\n\nThese reviews serve as a vital resource for other potential customers, assisting them in making decisions that are based on accurate information when it comes to deciding where to shop, dine, or hire services. Reviews on Yelp include information about the quality, customer service, and overall experience that are provided by a business, which is very helpful in determining the reputation of that business.\n\nYelp reviews are a route for feedback for companies, allowing them to communicate with customers, address complaints, and highlight their virtues. Yelp reviews act as a catalyst for the fluid exchange of information, which ultimately benefits customers and companies.\n\nWhen did Yelp Reviews begin?\n\nYelp Reviews began in July 2004 when Jeremy Stoppelman and Russel Simmons founded Yelp. The website was conceived as a medium through which users could offer recommendations and reviews concerning local organizations and services. Yelp has experienced tremendous expansion and developed into one of the most prominent review platforms worldwide since that time. The website now hosts millions of evaluations centered on a diverse selection of companies and locales.\n\nYelp had achieved a substantial revenue of $30 million, and its website had amassed approximately 4.5 million user-generated reviews by 2010. Yelp embarked on an expansion journey, extending its presence into European and Asian markets from 2009 to 2012.\n\nYelp engaged in discussions about a potential acquisition by Google in 2009, although these negotiations were ultimately unsuccessful. Yelp debuted as a publicly traded company through an initial public offering (IPO) in March 2012, and it achieved profitability for the first time within the following two years.\n\nHow do Yelp Reviews work?\n\nYelp Reviews works by enabling users to rate businesses on a scale of 1 to 5 stars and craft detailed reviews based on their interactions with those businesses. These ratings and reviews are publicly accessible and prominently displayed on a business’s Yelp page, making them visible to anyone searching for information about that establishment on the platform.\n\nYelp harnesses the collective input of registered users who actively engage in the platform by crafting detailed reviews and assigning ratings to various businesses, thus sharing their individual perspectives and valuable insights. The interactive nature of the platform allows fellow users to signal their concurrence or dissent with these reviews through the mechanisms of upvoting or downvoting. The participatory review evaluation system serves as a pivotal determinant in ascertaining the authenticity and trustworthiness of the posted reviews, contributing significantly to the platform’s credibility and the guidance it offers to potential customers.\n\nSuch an approach fosters a more accurate depiction of a business’s quality, as reviews with a higher number of upvotes are typically deemed more trustworthy. Businesses enhance their online reputation and engage with their clientele by taking control of their Yelp page, verifying their details, and responding to reviews.\n\nYelp employs various algorithms to determine which reviews are displayed on a business’s page, taking into account factors like the review’s relevance, the user’s review history, and the overall trustworthiness of the user’s contributions.\n\nYelp’s ratings and reviews system serves as a platform for customers to share their experiences while providing businesses with a means to connect with their patrons and cultivate a positive online reputation.\n\nWhat role does Review Management play in the context of Yelp Reviews?\n\nReview management plays a vital role in the context of Yelp reviews because it entails active monitoring, consumer involvement, and the provision of a response to customer comments via the site.\n\nBusinesses must take the time to carefully monitor and respond to customer feedback on the platform because Yelp reviews have such a massive impact on the decisions that customers make. It is necessary to monitor for new reviews frequently, manage reviews effectively, reply to good and negative feedback in a timely and professional manner, and resolve any issues or concerns that customers may raise.\n\nIncrease customer loyalty by acknowledging and responding to positive reviews while demonstrating a commitment to customer satisfaction by responding to unfavorable reviews and minimizing the harm they may have caused. Review management on Yelp is a proactive strategy to promote a favorable image and reputation for businesses within the Yelp community. It is vital for businesses because Yelp is a community that relies heavily on the site.\n\nHow do Yelp Reviews differ from other Business Reviews Sites?\n\nYelp reviews differ from other Business review sites because the platform has a solid foundation since its primary purpose is to provide users with a location where they can read and publish reviews. Even its algorithm is tailored specifically for such an objective.\n\nGoogle, as a dominant search engine, integrates user reviews into its platform seamlessly. Customers leave Google reviews with their existing Google accounts, and businesses actively request reviews by sharing a direct link. However, claiming and optimizing a Google Business listing is a prerequisite.\n\nYelp, on the other hand, operates more like an online bulletin board, where users need to create Yelp accounts to leave reviews. Yelp’s policies explicitly prohibit businesses from soliciting reviews by sending direct links. These fundamental differences between several business review sites impact how businesses interact with customers for review purposes on each platform.\n\nWhat is the importance of Yelp Reviews?\n\nThe importance of Yelp reviews in today’s business landscape serves as a critical bridge between consumers and businesses in the digital age. Millions of users rely on Yelp to find new products, services, and places to visit. Positive Yelp evaluations have a significant impact on the purchasing decisions of prospective customers because they provide real-world insights into a business’s quality and reputation. They serve as social proof, reassuring consumers that their decisions are well-informed.\n\nYelp assessments wield substantial influence over the virtual standing of a business. Yelp ratings and reviews are frequently the first impressions of a business in an era where online searches significantly influence consumer behavior. A high rating and a collection of positive evaluations increase the credibility and dependability of a business. Negative reviews or a low rating deter potential consumers, resulting in a potential revenue decline.\n\nYelp reviews provide businesses with valuable feedback and insights into consumer preferences, enabling them to make necessary adjustments. Reviews help identify areas where a company gets to improve its products, services, or customer experience, resulting in increased customer satisfaction and loyalty.\n\nYelp allows businesses the opportunity for direct engagement with consumers through the avenue of review responses. Acknowledging and addressing both favorable and unfavorable feedback is a testament to a commitment to exemplary customer service, effectively easing the adverse ramifications of unfavorable reviews. The act of actively engaging with reviewers cultivates a sense of communal rapport around a business, unequivocally showcasing its earnest regard for the perspectives and viewpoints of its clientele.\n\nPositive Yelp reviews and high ratings increase click-through rates to a business’s website from search engine results. Increased CTR indirectly influences SEO by sending positive signals to search engines regarding the website’s relevance and authority. Yelp reviews allow businesses to include relevant keywords in their business descriptions, categories, and tags. Businesses increase their chances of appearing in search results for those keywords by optimizing their Yelp profiles with relevant keywords.\n\nYelp evaluations contribute to healthy market competition in a broader context. They empower consumers to make well-informed decisions and encourage businesses to provide superior products and services. Businesses that consistently deliver exceptional customer service are rewarded with positive reviews, while those that fall short are prompted to improve.\n\nWhat are the advantages of having Yelp Reviews?\n\nThe Advantages of having Yelp Reviews are listed below.\n\nIncreased Visibility: Yelp is a popular platform, and having a presence there increases the business’s visibility, especially among users who use Yelp to discover new places.\n\nCredibility: Positive Yelp reviews build credibility and trust with future customers.

Showcase these reviews on the website, social media, or marketing materials to attract more customers.\n\nIt is Free: Creating and maintaining a Yelp profile is free, although fees are associated with customizing and optimizing a Yelp profile. Free advertising is difficult to refuse, particularly for smaller businesses.\n\nCompetitive Advantage: Outperforming competitors on Yelp give businesses a competitive advantage. Users often compare businesses and make decisions based on the reviews they read.\n\nLocal SEO: Yelp reviews contribute to your local SEO efforts, helping your business appear in local search results.\n\nRanking: Yelp typically ranks highly in Google, particularly if there is little competition for the business name. Maintaining excellent Yelp reviews is recommended if businesses want their website and positive reviews to appear in the top few results on Google.\n\nWhat is an example of a Yelp Review?\n\nAn example of a Yelp review is posted below.\n\n\n\nWhere to see the Yelp Reviews?\n\nTo see the Yelp reviews, simply visit the Yelp website or use the mobile app. Search for the business or location one is interested in, and the user is going to be directed to its Yelp page. The positive and negative feedback from previous customers is in the section devoted to customer evaluations. Yelp provides options to filter reviews based on criteria such as the most recent, highest-rated, or lowest-rated reviews, allowing users to gain a comprehensive understanding of how others have experienced a business. Businesses frequently display Yelp ratings and reviews on their websites and social media profiles to demonstrate consumer feedback to prospective customers.\n\nHow to appropriately respond to Yelp Reviews?\n\nTo appropriately respond to Yelp reviews requires a considerate and professional approach. Businesses must routinely check their Yelp page for fresh reviews. It is crucial to express gratitude for the feedback, whether positive or negative when responding. A straightforward thank-you note suffices for positive feedback.\n\nMaintaining a courteous and empathetic demeanor is paramount when crafting responses to negative reviews. It is imperative to address the customer’s concerns with a solution-oriented approach devoid of defensiveness. Providing clear and concise explanations or remedies is essential.\n\nExtend an invitation for private communication when appropriate, demonstrating a commitment to resolving the issue behind the scenes. One must remember that potential customers peruse these interactions, emphasizing the need for concise responses. Indeed, a business’s online reputation stands to gain considerable enhancement by employing professional and polite review responses.\n\nWhat is the character or word limit for Yelp Reviews?\n\nThe character limit or word limit for Yelp reviews is 5000. Yelp does not have a strict character or word limit for evaluations. However, there are limitations based on user behavior and the platform’s design. Users are encouraged to provide thorough and informative evaluations, but lengthy reviews may be less effective at conveying information to readers. The typical length of a Yelp review is between a few sentences and a few paragraphs. It enables reviewers to effectively share their experiences and opinions without overwhelming readers with excessive text. Reviewers must strive for clarity and relevance in their reviews to aid others in making informed decisions about businesses and services.\n\nWhat is the maximum star rating limit for Yelp Reviews?\n\nThe maximum star rating limit for Yelp reviews is five stars. Users have the ability to evaluate businesses and leave reviews using star ratings ranging from one to five, with five stars denoting the highest level of satisfaction and one star indicating the lowest. Reviewers have the ability to convey their thoughts and experiences in a manner that is concise and simple to comprehend through the use of a 5-star rating system, which assists other users in making educated selections regarding businesses and services.\n\nHow does Yelp software detect fake Yelp Reviews?\n\nYelp software detects fake Yelp reviews by employing automated software algorithms to detect and counteract fake reviews on its platform. Yelp employs automated software algorithms and a dedicated team of moderators. The software employs complex algorithms to analyze various aspects of reviews, such as language patterns, posting frequency, and IP addresses, to identify potentially fraudulent or manipulated reviews.\n\nThe Yelp community is encouraged to report dubious reviews, which human moderators review. These moderators have been trained to recognize indicators of phony reviews, such as excessively positive or negative language, suspicious posting behavior, and conflicts of interest. They evaluate the overall credibility of the reviewer. Yelp takes action when a false review is confirmed by removing the review or penalizing the business or individual responsible. The multifaceted approach helps preserve the authenticity and dependability of Yelp reviews.\n\nYelp employs various tactics to combat fake reviews, including identifying IP addresses associated with fraudulent positive reviews. The platform actively works to dismantle groups arranging paid reviews by tracking them on social media channels and collaborating with platforms like Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, and LinkedIn to disrupt these networks. The comprehensive approach is part of Yelp’s commitment to maintaining the authenticity and trustworthiness of its review ecosystem.\n\nMaintaining the integrity of reviews on a recommendation platform like Yelp is paramount. Yelp relies on recommendation software as its initial defense against fraudulent activities. The software operates dynamically, continuously monitoring user and business interactions on the platform to detect and prevent deceptive behavior. Such a proactive approach ensures that Yelp provides trustworthy and reliable user recommendations.\n\nWant to get more reviews?\n\nSee how easy it is to get reviews using ReputationStacker.\n\nSEE HOW IT WORKS\n\nAre Yelp Reviews Public?\n\nYes, Yelp reviews are public. Yelp reviews are open to the public and accessible to anyone visiting the Yelp website or mobile app. Yelp reviews intend for them to be shared with the public; when Yelp users post reviews, they help to improve the overall rating and reputation of companies listed on Yelp. These ratings and reviews are displayed to the public on a business’s Yelp page. They are visible to everyone searching for that company on the platform. Users have considerable control over their personal review privacy settings, while Yelp reviews are generally public.\n\nCan Yelp Reviews be set to Private?\n\nNo, Yelp Reviews cannot be set to private. Yelp does not allow users to set their reviews to private. It is typically visible to the public on the business’s Yelp page once a review is submitted on Yelp. Users have the ability to edit or delete their reviews, but they are not permitted to make them private or restrict access to them. Yelp’s approach is to maintain transparency and openness in its review system, allowing other consumers to benefit from and contribute to the platform’s collective knowledge about businesses.\n\nWhat are the guidelines for Yelp Reviews?\n\nThe guidelines for Yelp reviews ensure the authenticity and usefulness of the reviews. These guidelines cover various crucial aspects, including relevance (reviews should focus on the business in question), genuine experiences (reviews must be based on real personal experiences), privacy (no sharing of personal information), respectful language (maintaining civility), a ban on hate speech, a focus on non-promotional content, accuracy, and transparency regarding conflicts of interest. Yelp aims to provide valuable insights to consumers and businesses while maintaining platform credibility by adhering to these guidelines. Violations may lead to reviews being flagged or removed to preserve integrity.\n\nYelp encourages passionate and personal narratives enriched with detail and helpful tips for fellow consumers when writing reviews. The emphasis is on personal experience rather than secondhand information, avoiding broad generalizations. Factual accuracy is crucial, urging reviewers to express their opinions truthfully and avoid exaggerations. Review updates should convey new experiences or interactions rather than rehashing old stories, with the option to edit an existing review for added insights. The approach ensures that Yelp reviews are authentic, informative, and based on genuine consumer experiences.\n\nCan Businesses delete reviews on their Yelp Business Page?\n\nNo, businesses cannot directly delete reviews on their Yelp Business Page. Yelp maintains a stringent policy that disallows businesses from selectively removing reviews, irrespective of their tone, with the overarching goal of upholding the authenticity and unassailable integrity of its review ecosystem.\n\nYelp has implemented advanced algorithms and a set of community guidelines designed to identify and delete reviews that exhibit traits of being fabricated, spam-ridden, or inauthentic. Suppose businesses detect reviews that contravene Yelp’s content guidelines or appear fraudulent. They are encouraged to bring such matters to Yelp’s attention by flagging the reviews for meticulous review by Yelp’s dedicated team. The removal or retention of a review is contingent upon Yelp’s discernment and evaluation of its compliance with the platform’s policies. The multifaceted approach underscores Yelp’s unwavering commitment to maintaining a credible and reliable review landscape.\n\nIs it illegal to remove reviews on Yelp Business Page?\n\nNo, it is not illegal to remove reviews from a Yelp Business Page. However, business owners don’t have the ability to remove or delete reviews. Yelp has its own guidelines for removing reviews, and businesses have limited influence over the process.\n\nYelp removes reviews that contravene its content guidelines, including those that contain hate speech, personal attacks, false information, or fraud. Businesses have the option to report reviews they believe violate Yelp’s policies, and Yelp investigates these reports.\n\nBusinesses must not engage in fraudulent practices to remove or manipulate reviews, such as composing phony reviews or offering rewards for positive reviews. These actions result in Yelp penalties and have legal repercussions.\n\nCan Businesses hide reviews on their Yelp Business Page?\n\nNo, businesses cannot hide reviews on their Yelp Business Page. Companies are prohibited from concealing or deleting reviews directly from their Yelp Business Page. Yelp has policies to ensure the validity of reviews, and businesses are typically not permitted to conceal reviews selectively. However, Yelp has an algorithm that automatically identifies which ratings are displayed and which are filtered out.\n\nYelp’s review filtration system is designed to accentuate the utmost authenticity and objectivity in reviews by identifying and suppressing those it deems potentially inauthentic or solicited. Yelp’s algorithm subsequently unveils them to the public once it ascertains their veracity, while such a meticulous filtering process accidentally captures some genuinely legitimate reviews. The sophisticated mechanism reflects Yelp’s commitment to maintaining the credibility and reliability of its review ecosystem.\n\nBusinesses, however, have the option to respond to filtered and unfiltered reviews. Responding to reviews, whether positive or negative, is an excellent way for businesses to engage with customers and demonstrate their commitment to addressing feedback.\n\nBusinesses must adhere to Yelp’s policies and guidelines to maintain a positive online presence. The ideal strategy is to encourage genuine reviews by providing excellent service and engaging with customers.\n\nHow to get Yelp Reviews?\n\nTo get Yelp Reviews, follow the steps below.\n\nClaim and Enhance the Yelp Business Page. Ensure the business is listed on Yelp and claim ownership of the business page. Complete all the profile details, including correct contact details, business hours, and images.\n\nProvide Excellent Customer Service. The best way to get positive reviews is to provide outstanding service and products to customers. Delighted customers are more likely to provide good feedback.\n\nInteract with Customers. Respond to existing reviews, positive and negative, to show that customer feedback is valued. Encourage customers to follow the business on Yelp to stay updated. Businesses must understand how to get Yelp reviews by interacting with their clients.\n\nUtilize Yelp Stickers and Badges. Display Yelp stickers or badges in a physical location and on the website to inform customers that the business is on Yelp.\n\nShare Yelp Reviews on Social Media. Businesses are not allowed to request reviews; however, posting current reviews is allowed. Consider reviews to be content. Quote the top reviews, then turn them into an appealing social media image and share them. There’s nothing wrong with telling consumers how much they adore the business.\n\nSimplify the Task. Provide a direct link to the Yelp page on the website, in email signatures, and on social media. It makes it convenient for customers to leave reviews.\n\nHost Yelp Events. Set up special events or promotions for Yelp users. Yelp hosts events like “Yelp Elite” gatherings, which help someone connect with active Yelp reviewers.\n\nBe Patient. Building a collection of reviews takes time. Be patient and persistent in encouraging customers to leave feedback.\n\nHow to get a Yelp Review link?\n\nTo get the Yelp review link, follow the steps below.\n\nOpen a web browser and proceed to the Yelp website (www.yelp.com).\n\nType the business name and location in the search bar at the top.\n\nLocate the business in the search results and click on it to access the business page.\n\nLook for the “Write a Review” button on the business page. Click on it.\n\nCopy the URL from the browser’s address bar. Customers and clients are welcome and encouraged to post Yelp reviews for their business by sharing the link.\n\nWhat are the disadvantages of Yelp Reviews?\n\nThe disadvantages of Yelp Reviews are listed below.\n\nBiased Reviews: Yelp reviews tend to be biased toward extreme viewpoints. Some users post overly negative or overly positive reviews, making it challenging to get a balanced perspective.\n\nNegative Impact on Businesses: A single negative review, whether accurate or not, significantly impacts a business’s reputation and revenue. Businesses sometimes struggle to address or remove unfair negative reviews.\n\nInfluence of Unverified Users: Yelp allows anyone to post reviews, even if they haven’t verified that they’ve visited the business. It leads to fake reviews or reviews based on hearsay.\n\nReview Filter: Yelp employs an automated review filter to screen out potentially fake or biased reviews. However, the filter is only sometimes accurate and hides legitimate reviews, causing frustration for business owners.\n\nLimited Control: Business owners have limited control over their Yelp pages. They are not allowed to remove reviews by themselves, and disputes about reviews are time-consuming.\n\nPaid Services: Yelp offers advertising services that help businesses gain more visibility. Some business owners, however, feel compelled to pay for these services to counteract negative reviews or improve their overall Yelp rating.\n\nRemoving False Reviews: Select the “flag” icon at the review’s bottom to report a fraudulent review. Answer a succession of questions. Moderators on Yelp then evaluate the responses. It is historically challenging and one of the most significant disadvantages of the platform. Claim the business first to withdraw a Yelp review.\n\nAdvertising Pressure: Some businesses have reported that Yelp sales representatives have pressured them to advertise on the platform in exchange for better review placement or the removal of negative reviews. Yelp denies such rumors, but the perception exists.\n\nThe Cost: Yelp uses CPC (cost-per-click) advertising, according to the 39 Celsius website. Advertisers spend $0.30 to $40 per click, especially in competitive industries like the legal profession. Yelp lets advertisers specify a monthly budget, but not all clicks lead to excellent leads, which wastes marketing cash.\n\nLead Inflation: Lead generation through Yelp is not advantageous. Yelp considers photo submissions, map views, website clicks, and bookmarked pages to be “leads.” Business owners typically define a lead as a completed contact form, email, or phone call.\n\nDoes deleting Yelp Profile remove reviews?\n\nNo, deleting a Yelp Profile does not remove reviews automatically. The reviews that someone has written about their business, as well as the ones that others have submitted, become deleted one by one over time. The reviews someone wrote as a user remain even if they delete their Yelp account.\n\nThe reviews people have written about your business remain there if someone owns a company and deletes their business page. These reviews are still part of Yelp’s public site, so they are still visible. Businesses or companies must contact Yelp’s support team and ask them to look at it based on their content standards if they want a particular review to be taken down.\n\nWhy can’t I see the reviews on my Google Business Profile?\n\nIf you can’t see the reviews on your Google Business Profile, several reasons explain such an issue. One reason is that Google’s moderation system still needs to give its stamp of approval to the reviews. Google frequently examines user-generated information, such as reviews, to see whether or not it complies with the company’s regulations. Reviews are viewable after approval during the phase of the process.\n\nAnother potential cause is a technical glitch or delay on Google’s end. Updates to business profiles and reviews take time to propagate through Google’s systems, resulting in brief outages. Google’s algorithms, which aim to present a representative sample of evaluations, hide some reviews if someone’s business has a small number of them.\n\nGoogle maintains rigorous policies governing customer reviews to safeguard the integrity of its platform. These policies revolve around two core guidelines: Prohibited and Restricted Content and Format-Specific Criteria for Reviews and Captions. These guidelines serve as a crucial framework to ensure that reviews and captions posted on Google adhere to specific criteria and remain compliant with Google’s content standards. Google removes reviews that violate these policies to maintain the quality and reliability of the review system.\n\nGoogle’s Prohibited and Restricted Content Policy is a comprehensive framework outlining the categories of content that are strictly prohibited on the platform. It encompasses a wide range of content, including but not limited to illegal materials, content that promotes hate or violence, disclosures of personal and confidential information, sexually explicit material, and fraudulent or misleading information. A business review was removed due to violations of these policies if one notices that one of their business reviews has mysteriously disappeared.\n\nGoogle maintains a vigilant stance on promptly flagging and eliminating reviews that fall short of its content standards, all to uphold the integrity and credibility of its platform. Google’s format-specific criteria for reviews and captions are designed to ensure the content remains helpful and unbiased for all users. It’s important to note that businesses cannot selectively request only positive reviews, discourage negative ones, or engage in paid review manipulation.\n\nCan a bad Facebook review ruin a business?\n\nYes, a bad Facebook review can ruin a business. A negative review posted on Facebook has the potential to have a big effect on a company. The reputation of a company is significantly shaped by online reviews, especially those left on Facebook. These reviews have a significant impact on customers’ purchasing decisions.\n\nProspective customers frequently check reviews to understand the product’s quality, dependability, and overall customer satisfaction when they research a company. A poor review turns away potential customers because it raises questions about the quality of the company’s goods or services.\n\nThe followers of the company, as well as anyone who visits their page, see the very visible reviews. It further amplifies the impact of a negative review, especially if the review is unfavorable. The magnitude of the harm, however, varies depending on several things, such as how the company reacts to the review, the general review profile of the company, and the credibility of the bad feedback given.\n\nUnfavorable experiences have the potential to be transformed into opportunities for growth and good consumer interaction through proactive reputation management and professional replies to negative reviews. It helps reduce the impact of the encounter.\n\nCan new accounts make Yelp reviews?\n\nYes, new accounts can make Yelp reviews. Yelp encourages its users, including those who have recently created accounts, to share their experiences and thoughts by leaving reviews for businesses. New users rate businesses on a scale of one to five stars and provide in-depth reviews based on their own experiences. Yelp places a high importance on contributions made by new and long-standing members of its community. It allows Yelp to offer a diverse range of viewpoints and insights to other users who are looking for information on companies and services. It doesn’t matter if a Yelp account is just new; what matters to the platform are the reviews coming from genuine Yelp users.\n\nHow to leave a Review on Yelp?\n\nTo leave a review on Yelp, follow the steps below.\n\nSign In or Create an Account. Sign in using an existing account; otherwise, create a Yelp account.\n\nSearch for the Business. Use the search bar at the top of the Yelp website or app to find the business that needs to be reviewed.\n\nSelect the Business. Click on the business listing to view its details.\n\nClick on “Write a Review”. Users find the option near the top of the business’s Yelp page.\n\nChoose a Star Rating. Rate the business on a scale of one to five stars, with one being the lowest and five being the highest.\n\nWrite Your Review. Share a detailed review of one’s experience with the business in the text box provided. Be honest and provide as much information as possible to help others.\n\nAdd Photos (Optional). Users get to upload photos related to their experience. The step is optional but helps provide visual context to your review.\n\nProofread Your Review. Take a moment to review the text and make sure it accurately reflects the individual’s thoughts.\n\nClick “Post”. Click the “Post” button to publish it on Yelp after writing the review.\n\nIs it possible to leave Google Reviews without a Yelp account?\n\nYes, it is possible to leave Google Reviews without a Yelp account. Google Reviews and Yelp operate as separate review platforms, and having an account on one does not impact an individual’s ability to make reviews on the other. It is necessary for a person to have a Google account to submit a Google Review; however, having a Google account is not the same as having a Yelp account. A Google account is created with an email address, and users post reviews for businesses and other services directly on Google Maps or the Google My Business platform without affiliation with Yelp.\n\nGoogle Reviews needs a Google Account, whereas Yelp Reviews requires a Yelp account. Each platform has its own account system, so users get to use one without having an account on the other. Users engage with either platform without any obligation to join the other, providing flexibility and choice based on individual preferences and needs.\n\nAre Yelp Reviews Reliable?\n\nYes, Yelp reviews are reliable. Yelp reviews are a helpful resource, but their dependability depends on several variables. Diverse experiences and subjective opinions of reviewers result in divergent perspectives on the same business. It is prudent to consult multiple reviews for a comprehensive assessment of reliability.\n\nBe aware that fake evaluations, whether excessively positive or negative, occasionally appear on Yelp despite the platform’s efforts to combat such issues. Examine feedback for consistency, especially if certain aspects of a business are repeatedly mentioned. Reviews with accompanying images provide visual evidence, thereby increasing their credibility. Consider the background and reputation of reviewers, as seasoned contributors offer more trustworthy opinions.\n\nConsider business proprietors’ responses, as professional and constructive responses to negative feedback indicate positive customer service. A prudent approach and cross-referencing with other sources help ensure their credibility, although Yelp reviews are informative.\n\nWhat is the difference between Yelp, Google, and Facebook Reviews?\n\nThe difference between Yelp, Google, and Facebook Reviews is that Yelp focuses predominantly on reviews of local businesses and services. It provides users with comprehensive information about restaurants, shops, and other establishments. It provides a comprehensive rating and reviews system that assists users in making informed decisions.\n\nGoogle Reviews, on the other hand, is integrated with Google Maps and focuses on reviewing various businesses and locations around the globe. It is convenient to locate local businesses and services. Facebook Reviews enables users to rate and review businesses with a Facebook presence as part of the social media behemoth. It frequently caters to companies that interact with their audience on the platform. Each platform has a distinct user base and set of features, making them valuable resources for consumers searching for diverse businesses and experiences. The difference between Yelp, Google, and Facebook Reviews lies in their user interfaces, target audiences, and review formats, although all three platforms contribute to online reputation management"

Wade, a landmark case for the protection of women's rights and interests, was overruled less than half a century later, and the argument for the decision in this case takes a very different line of thinking from Roe v. Wade.Please read the case details and the court's decision process carefully.\n\n\n\nDobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization\n\n“We hold that Roe and Casey must be overruled. The Constitution makes no reference to abortion, and no such right is implicitly protected by any constitutional provision, including the one on which the defenders of Roe and Casey now chiefly rely—the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.”—— Justice Samuel Alito (Majority)\n\nSummary\n\nDobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization was a landmark decision addressing whether the Constitution protects the right to an abortion.  In Dobbs, the Supreme Court reviewed the constitutionality of Mississippi’s Gestational Age Act—a law banning most abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy with exceptions for medical emergencies and fetal abnormalities.  In a divided opinion, the Court upheld the Mississippi law and overturned Roe v. Wade (1973) and Planned Parenthood v. Casey (1992)—concluding that the Constitution does not protect the right to an abortion.  As a result, the Court’s decision returned the issue of abortion regulation to the elected branches.  In an opinion concurring in the judgment, Chief Justice Roberts agreed to uphold the Mississippi law, but chided the majority for reaching out to decide the broader question of whether to overrule Roe and Casey.  He would have left that important constitutional question to a future case.  Finally, in a rare joint dissent, Justices Breyer, Kagan, and Sotomayor criticized the Court for unsettling nearly five decades of precedent and undermining the Constitution’s promise of freedom and equality for women.\n\nRead the Full Opinion\n\nExcerpt: Majority Opinion, Justice Samuel Alito\n\nFor the first 185 years after the adoption of the Constitution, each State was permitted to address this issue in accordance with the views of its citizens.  Then, in 1973, this Court decided Roe v. Wade.  Even though the Constitution makes no mention of abortion, the Court held that it confers a broad right to obtain one.  It did not claim that American law or the common law had ever recognized such a right, and its survey ranged from the constitutionally irrelevant (e.g., its discussion of abortion in antiquity) to the plainly incorrect (e.g., its assertion that abortion was probably never a crime under the common law).  After cataloging a wealth of other information having no bearing on the meaning of the Constitution, the opinion concluded with a numbered set of rules much like those that might be found in a statute enacted by a legislature.\n\nUnder this scheme, each trimester of pregnancy was regulated differently, but the most critical line was drawn at roughly the end of the second trimester, which, at the time, corresponded to the point in which a fetus was thought to achieve “viability,” i.e., the ability to survive outside the womb.  Although the Court acknowledged that States had a legitimate interest in protecting “potential life,” it found that this interest could not justify any restriction on pre-viability abortions.  The Court did not explain the basis for this line, and even abortion supporters have found it hard to defend Roe’s reasoning.\n\nAt the time of Roe, 30 States still prohibited abortion at all stages.  In the years prior to that decision, about a third of States had liberalized their laws, but Roe abruptly ended that political process.  It imposed the same highly restrictive regime on the entire Nation, and it effectively struck down the abortion laws of every single State.\n\nEventually, in Planned Parenthood v. Casey, the Court revisited Roe . . . . The opinion concluded that stare decisis, which calls for prior decisions to be followed in most instances, required adherence to what it called Roe’s “central holding”—that a State may not constitutionally protect fetal life before “viability”—even if that holding was wrong.\n\nCasey threw out Roe’s trimester scheme and substituted a new rule of uncertain origin under which States were forbidden to adopt any regulation that imposed an ‘undue burden’ on a woman’s right to have an abortion. . . . The three Justices who authored the controlling opinion “call[ed] for the contending sides of a national controversy to end their national division” by treating the Court’s decision as the final settlement of the question of the constitutional right to abortion.\n\nAs has become increasingly apparent in the intervening years, Casey did not achieve that goal.  Americans continue to hold passionate and widely divergent views on abortion, and state legislatures have acted accordingly.  Some have recently enacted laws allowing abortion, with few restrictions, at all stage of pregnancy.  Others have tightly restricted abortion beginning well before viability.  And in this case, 26 States have expressly asked this Court to overrule Roe and Casey and allow the States to regulate or prohibit pre-viability abortions.\n\nBefore us now is one such state law.  The State of Mississippi asks us to uphold the constitutionality of a law that generally prohibits an abortion after the 15th week of pregnancy—several weeks before the point at which a fetus is now regarded as “viable” outside the womb.  In defending this law, the State’s primary argument is that we should reconsider and overrule Roe and Casey and once again allow each State to regulate abortion as its citizens wish.  On the other side, respondents and the Solicitor General ask us to reaffirm Roe and Casey, and they contend that the Mississippi law cannot stand if we do so.\n\nWe hold that Roe and Casey must be overruled. The Constitution makes no reference to abortion, and no such right is implicitly protected by any constitutional provision, including the one on which the defenders of Roe and Casey now chiefly rely—the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. That provision has been held to guarantee some rights that are not mentioned in the Constitution, but any such right must be “deeply rooted in this Nation’s history and tradition” and “implicit in the concept of ordered liberty.” \n\nThe right to abortion does not fall within this category. Until the latter part of the 20th century, such a right was entirely unknown in American law. Indeed, when the Fourteenth Amendment was adopted, three quarters of the States made abortion a crime at all stages of pregnancy. The abortion right is also critically different from any other right that this Court has held to fall within the Fourteenth Amendment’s protection of “liberty.” Roe’s defenders characterize the abortion right as similar to the rights recognized in past decisions involving matters such as intimate sexual relations, contraception, and marriage, but abortion is fundamentally different, as both Roe and Casey acknowledged, because it destroys what those decisions called “fetal life” and what the law now before us describes as an “unborn human being.”\n\nStare decisis, the doctrine on which Casey’s controlling opinion was based, does not compel unending adherence to Roe’s abuse of judicial authority. Roe was egregiously wrong from the start. Its reasoning was exceptionally weak, and the decision has had damaging consequences. And far from bringing about a national settlement of the abortion issue, Roe and Casey have enflamed debate and deepened division. \n\nIt is time to heed the Constitution and return the issue of abortion to the people’s elected representatives. . . .\n\nWe discuss [substantive due process] in depth below, but before doing so, we briefly address one additional constitutional provision that some of respondents’ amici have now offered as yet another potential home for the abortion right: the Fourteenth Amendment’s Equal Protection Clause. . . . Neither Roe nor Casey saw fit to invoke this theory, and it is squarely foreclosed by our precedents, which establish that a State’s regulation of abortion is not a sex-based classification and is thus not subject to the “heightened scrutiny” that applies to such classifications. . . . The regulation of a medical procedure that only one sex can undergo does not trigger heightened constitutional scrutiny unless the regulation is a “mere pretex[t] designed to effect an invidious discrimination against members of one sex or the other.” . . . And as the Court has stated, the “goal of preventing abortion” does not constitute “invidiously discriminatory animus” against women. . . .\n\nWith this new theory addressed, we turn to Casey’s bold assertion that the abortion right is an aspect of the “liberty” protected by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. . . .\n\nWe begin by considering the critical question of whether the Constitution, properly understood, confers a right to obtain an abortion. . . .\n\nThe Constitution makes no express reference to a right to obtain an abortion, and therefore those who claim that it protects such a right much show that the right is somehow implicit in the constitutional text. . . .\n\nIn interpreting what is meant by the Fourteenth Amendment’s reference to ‘liberty,’ we must guard against the natural human tendency to confuse what the Amendment protects with our own ardent views about the liberty that Americans should enjoy.  That is why the Court has long been reluctant to recognize rights that are not mentioned in the Constitution. . . . Instead, guided by the history and tradition that map the essential components of our Nation’s concept of ordered liberty, we must ask what the Fourteenth Amendment means by the term “liberty.” When we engage in that inquiry in the present case, the clear answer is that the Fourteenth Amendment does not protect the right to an abortion. \n\nUntil the latter part of the 20th century, there was no support in American law for a constitutional right to obtain an abortion. No state constitutional provision had recognized such a right. Until a few years before Roe was handed down, no federal or state court had recognized such a right. Nor had any scholarly treatise of which we are aware.  And although law review articles are not reticent about advocating new rights, the earliest article proposing a constitutional right to an abortion that has come to our attention was published only a few years before Roe.\n\nNot only was there no support for such a constitutional right until shortly before Roe, but abortion had long been a crime in every single State. At common law, abortion was criminal in at least some stages of pregnancy and was regarded as unlawful and could have very serious consequences at all stages. American law followed the common law until a wave of statutory restrictions in the 1800s expanded criminal liability for abortions. By the time of the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment, three-quarters of the States had made abortion a crime at any stage of pregnancy, and the remaining States would soon follow. . . .\n\nThis overwhelming consensus endured until the day Roe was decided. At that time, also by the Roe Court’s own count, a substantial majority—30 States—still prohibited abortion at all stages except to save the life of the mother. And though Roe discerned a “trend toward liberalization” in about “one-third of the States,” those States still criminalized some abortions and regulated them more stringently than Roe would allow. . . .\n\nThe inescapable conclusion is that a right to abortion is not deeply rooted in the Nation’s history and traditions. On the contrary, an unbroken tradition of prohibiting abortion on pain of criminal punishment persisted from the earliest days of the common law until 1973 . . . .\n\nWe next consider whether the doctrine of stare decisis counsels continued acceptance of Roe and Casey . . . .\n\nIn this case, five factors weigh strongly in favor of overruling Roe and Casey: the nature of their error, the quality of their reasoning, the “workability” of the rules they imposed on the country, their disruptive effect on other areas of the law, and the absence of concrete reliance . . . .\n\n[T]o ensure that our decision is not misunderstood or mischaracterized, we emphasize that our decision concerns the constitutional right to abortion and no other right. Nothing in this opinion should be understood to cast doubt on precedents that do not concern abortion . . . .\n\nWe do not pretend to know how our political system or society will respond to today’s decision overruling Roe and Casey. And even if we could foresee what will happen, we would have no authority to let that knowledge influence our decision. We can only do our job, which is to interpret the law, apply longstanding principles of stare decisis, and decide this case accordingly.\n\nWe therefore hold that the Constitution does not confer a right to abortion. Roe and Casey must be overruled . . . .\n\nWe must now decide what standard will govern if state abortion regulations undergo constitutional challenge and whether the law before us satisfies the appropriate standard. . . . Under our precedents, rational-basis review is the appropriate standard for such challenges. . . .\n\nWe end this opinion where we began.  Abortion presents a profound moral question.  The Constitution does not prohibit the citizens of each State from regulating or prohibiting abortion.  Roe and Casey arrogated that authority.  We now overrule those decisions and return that authority to the people and their elected representatives.\n\nExcerpt: Concurrence, Justice Brett Kavanaugh\n\nAbortion is a profoundly difficult and contentious issue because it presents an irreconcilable conflict between the interests of a pregnant woman who seeks an abortion and the interests of protecting fetal life.  The interests on both sides of the abortion issue are extraordinarily weighty.\n\nThe issue before this Court . . . is not the policy or morality of abortion.  The issue before the Court is what the Constitution says about abortion.  The Constitution does not take sides on the issue of abortion. . . . On the question of abortion, the Constitution is . . . neither pro-life nor pro-choice.  The Constitution is neutral and leaves the issue for the people and their elected representatives to resolve through the democratic process in the States or Congress—like the numerous other difficult questions of American social and economic policy that the Constitution does not address. . . .\n\nAfter today’s decision, the nine Members of this Court will no longer decide the basic legality of pre-viability abortion for all 330 million Americans. . . . But the parties’ arguments have raised other related questions, and I address some of them here. \n\nFirst, is the question of how this decision will affect other precedents involving issues such as contraception and marriage—in particular, the decisions in Griswold v. Connecticut . . . , Eisenstadt v. Baird . . . , Loving v. Virginia . . . , and Obergefell v. Hodges . . . . I emphasize what the Court today states: Overruling Roe does not mean the overruling of those precedents, and does not threaten or cast doubt on those precedents. \n\nSecond, as I see it, some of the other abortion-related legal questions raised by today’s decision are not especially difficult as a constitutional matter. For example, may a State bar a resident of that State from traveling to another State to obtain an abortion? In my view, the answer is no based on the constitutional right to interstate travel. May a State retroactively impose liability or punishment for an abortion that occurred before today’s decision takes effect? In my view, the answer is no based on the Due Process Clause or the Ex Post Facto Clause.\n\nExcerpt: Concurrence, Justice Clarence Thomas\n\nI write separately to emphasize a . . . more fundamental reason why there is no abortion right guarantee lurking in the Due Process Clause.  Considerable historical evidence indicates that “due process of law” merely requires executive and judicial actors to comply with legislative enactments and the common law when depriving a person of life, liberty, or property. . . . [T]he Due Process Clause at most guarantees process.  It does not, as the Court’s substantive due process cases suppose, “forbi[d] the government to infringe certain ‘fundamental’ liberty interests at all, no matter what process is provided.” . . .\n\n In future cases, we should reconsider all of this Court’s substantive due process precedents, including Griswold [v. Connecticut], Lawrence [v. Texas], and Obergefell [v. Hodges]. Because any substantive due process decision is “demonstrably erroneous” . . . , we have a duty to “correct the error” established in those precedents . . . . After overruling these demonstrably erroneous decisions, the question would remain whether other constitutional provisions guarantee the myriad rights that our substantive due process cases have generated. For example, we could consider whether any of the rights announced in this Court’s substantive due process cases are “privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States” protected by the Fourteenth Amendment. \n\nSubstantive due process exalts judges at the expense of the People from whom they derive their authority. . . . In practice, the Court’s approach for identifying those fundamental rights unquestionably involves policymaking rather than neutral legal analysis.  The Court divines new rights in line with its own, extraconstitutional value preferences and nullifies state laws that do not align with the judicially created rights.\n\nSubstantive due process . . . has harmed our country in many ways.  Accordingly, we should eliminate it from our jurisprudence at the earliest opportunity.  \n\nExcerpt: Concurring in the Judgment, Chief Justice John Roberts\n\nI would take a more measured course. I agree with the Court that the viability line established by Roe and Casey should be discarded under a straightforward stare decisis analysis. That line never made any sense. Our abortion precedents describe the right at issue as a woman’s right to choose to terminate her pregnancy. That right should therefore extend far enough to ensure a reasonable opportunity to choose, but need not extend any further— certainly not all the way to viability. Mississippi’s law allows a woman three months to obtain an abortion, well be-yond the point at which it is considered “late” to discover a pregnancy… I see no sound basis for questioning the adequacy of that opportunity.\n\nBut that is all I would say, out of adherence to a simple yet fundamental principle of judicial restraint: If it is not necessary to decide more to dispose of a case, then it is necessary not to decide more. Perhaps we are not always perfect in following that command, and certainly there are cases that warrant an exception. But this is not one of them. Surely we should adhere closely to principles of judicial restraint here, where the broader path the Court chooses entails repudiating a constitutional right we have not only previously recognized, but also expressly reaffirmed applying the doctrine of stare decisis. The Court’s opinion is thoughtful and thorough, but those virtues cannot compensate for the fact that its dramatic and consequential ruling is unnecessary to decide the case before us. . . .\n\nHere, there is a clear path to deciding this case correctly without overruling Roe all the way down to the studs: recognize that the viability line must be discarded, as the majority rightly does, and leave for another day whether to reject any right to an abortion at all. . . .\n\nAlmost all know [about a pregnancy] by the end of the first trimester.  Safe and effective abortifacients, moreover, are now readily available, particularly during those early stages.  Given all this, it is no surprise that the vast majority of abortions happen in the first trimester.  Presumably most of the remainder would also take place earlier if later abortions were not a legal option.  Ample evidence thus suggests that a 15-week ban provides sufficient time, absent rare circumstances, for a woman to decide for herself whether to terminate her pregnancy. . . .\n\nThe Court’s decision to overrule Roe and Casey is a serious jolt to the legal system—regardless of how you view those cases. A narrower decision rejecting the misguided viability line would be markedly less unsettling, and nothing more is needed to decide this case. . . .\n\nBoth the Court’s opinion and the dissent display a relentless freedom from doubt on the legal issue that I cannot share.  I am not sure, for example, that a ban on terminating a pregnancy from the moment of conception must be treated the same under the Constitution as a ban after fifteen weeks. . . . I would decide the question we granted review to answer—whether the previously recognized abortion right bars all abortion restrictions prior to viability, such that a ban on abortions after fifteen weeks of pregnancy is necessarily unlawful.  The answer to that question is no, and there is no need to go further to decide this case.\n\nExcerpt: Joint Dissent, Justices Stephen Breyer, Elena Kagan, and Sonia Sotomayor\n\nFor half a century, Roe v. Wade and Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa. v. Casey have protected the liberty and equality of women.  Roe held, and Casey reaffirmed, that the Constitution safeguards a woman’s right to decide for herself whether to bear a child.  Roe held, and Casey reaffirmed, that in the first stages of pregnancy, the government could not make that choice for women.  The government could not control a woman’s body or the course of a woman’s life: It could not determine what the woman’s future would be.  Respecting a woman as an autonomous being, and granting her full equality, meant giving her substantial choice over this most personal and most consequential of all life decisions.\n\nThe Court struck a balance, as it often does when values and goals compete.  It held that the State could prohibit abortions until after fetal viability, so long as the ban contained exceptions to safeguard a woman’s life or health.  It held that even before viability, the State could regulate the abortion procedure in multiple and meaningful ways.  But until the viability line was crossed, the Court held, a State could not impose a “substantial obstacle” on a woman’s “right to elect the procedure” as she (not the government) thought proper, in light of all the circumstances and complexities of her own life.\n\nToday, the Court discards that balance.  It says that from the very moment of fertilization, a woman has no rights to speak of. . . .\n\nOne result of today’s decision is certain: the curtailment of women’s rights, and of their status as free and equal citizens. Yesterday, the Constitution guaranteed that a woman confronted with an unplanned pregnancy could (within reasonable limits) make her own decision about whether to bear a child, with all the life-transforming consequences that act involves. And in thus safeguarding each woman’s reproductive freedom, the Constitution also protected “[t]he ability of women to participate equally in [this Nation’s] economic and social life.” . . .  But no longer. As of today, this Court holds, a State can always force a woman to give birth, prohibiting even the earliest abortions. A State can thus transform what, when freely undertaken, is a wonder into what, when forced, may be a nightmare. Some women, especially women of means, will find ways around the State’s assertion of power. Others—those without money or childcare or the ability to take time off from work—will not be so fortunate. Maybe they will try an unsafe method of abortion, and come to physical harm, or even die. Maybe they will undergo pregnancy and have a child, but at significant personal or familial cost. At the least, they will incur the cost of losing control of their lives. The Constitution will, today’s majority holds, provide no shield, despite its guarantees of liberty and equality for all.\n\nAnd no one should be confident that this majority is done with its work. The right Roe and Casey recognized does not stand alone. To the contrary, the Court has linked it for decades to other settled freedoms involving bodily integrity, familial relationships, and procreation. Most obviously, the right to terminate a pregnancy arose straight out of the right to purchase and use contraception. . . . In turn, those rights led, more recently, to rights of same-sex intimacy and marriage. . . . They are all part of the same constitutional fabric, protecting autonomous decision making over the most personal of life decisions. . . .\n\nThe majority has no good reason for the upheaval in law and society it sets off. Roe and Casey have been the law of the land for decades, shaping women’s expectations of their choices when an unplanned pregnancy occurs. Women have relied on the availability of abortion both in structuring their relationships and in planning their lives. The legal framework Roe and Casey developed to balance the competing interests in this sphere has proved workable in courts across the country. No recent developments, in either law or fact, have eroded or cast doubt on those precedents. Nothing, in short, has changed. . . . The Court reverses course today for one reason and one reason only: because the composition of this Court has changed. Stare decisis, this Court has often said, contributes to the actual and perceived integrity of the judicial process by ensuring that decisions are founded in the law rather than in the proclivities of individuals.  Today, the proclivities of individuals rule.  The Court departs from its obligation to faithfully and impartially apply the law.  We dissent. . . .\n\nThe majority would allow States to ban abortion from conception onward because it does not think forced childbirth at all implicates a woman’s rights to equality and freedom. Today’s Court, that is, does not think there is anything of constitutional significance attached to a woman’s control of her body and the path of her life. Roe and Casey thought that one-sided view misguided. In some sense, that is the difference in a nutshell between our precedents and the majority opinion. The constitutional regime we have lived in for the last 50 years recognized competing interests, and sought a balance between them. The constitutional regime we enter today erases the woman’s interest and recognizes only the State’s (or the Federal Government’s). \n\nThe majority makes this change based on a single question: Did the reproductive right recognized in Roe and Casey exist in “1868, the year when the Fourteenth Amendment was ratified?” . . . The majority says (and with this much we agree) that the answer to this question is no: In 1868, there was no nationwide right to end a pregnancy, and no thought that the Fourteenth Amendment provided one.\n\nOf course, the majority opinion refers as well to some later and earlier history. On the one side of 1868, it goes back as far as the 13th (the 13th!) century. . . . But that turns out to be wheel-spinning. First, it is not clear what relevance such early history should have, even to the majority. . . . If the early history obviously supported abortion rights, the majority would no doubt say that only the views of the Fourteenth Amendment’s ratifiers are germane. . . . Second—and embarrassingly for the majority—early law in fact does provide some support for abortion rights. Common-law authorities did not treat abortion as a crime before “quickening”—the point when the fetus moved in the womb. And early American law followed the common-law rule. So the criminal law of that early time might be taken as roughly consonant with Roe’s and Casey’s different treatment of early and late abortions. Better, then, to move forward in time. On the other side of 1868, the majority occasionally notes that many States barred abortion up to the time of Roe. That is convenient for the majority, but it is window dressing… Had the pre-Roe liberalization of abortion laws occurred more quickly and more widely in the 20th century, the majority would say (once again) that only the ratifiers’views are germane.\n\nThe majority’s core legal postulate, then, is that we in the 21st century must read the Fourteenth Amendment just as its ratifiers did. And that is indeed what the majority emphasizes over and over again. . . . If the ratifiers did not understand something as central to freedom, then neither can we.  Or said more particularly: If those people did not understand reproductive rights as part of the guarantee of liberty conferred in the Fourteenth Amendment, then those rights do not exist.\n\nAs an initial matter, note a mistake in the just preceding sentence.  We referred to the “people” who ratified the Fourteenth Amendment: What rights did those “people” have in their heads at the time? But, of course, “people” did not ratify the Fourteenth Amendment. Men did. So it is perhaps not so surprising that the ratifiers were not perfectly attuned to the importance of reproductive rights for women’s liberty, or for their capacity to participate as equal members of our Nation. Indeed, the ratifiers—both in 1868 and when the original Constitution was approved in 1788—did not understand women as full members of the community embraced by the phrase “We the People.” In 1868, the first wave of American feminists were explicitly told—of course by men—that it was not their time to seek constitutional protections. (Women would not get even the vote for another half-century.). . . . Those responsible for the original Constitution, including the Fourteenth Amendment, did not perceive women as equals, and did not recognize women’s rights. When the majority says that we must read our foundational charter as viewed at the time of ratification (except that we may also check it against the Dark Ages), it consigns women to second-class citizenship. . . .\n\nSo how is it that, as Casey said, our Constitution, read now, grants rights to women, though it did not in 1868?  How is it that our Constitution subjects discrimination against them to heightened scrutiny?  How is it that our Constitution, through the Fourteenth Amendment’s liberty clause, guarantees access to contraception (also not legally protected in 1868) so that women can decide for themselves whether and when to bear a child?  How is it that until today, that same constitutional clause protected a woman’s right, in the event contraception failed, to end a pregnancy in its earlier stages?\n\nThe answer is that this Court has rejected the majority’s pinched view of how to read our Constitution. . . . [I]n the words of the great Chief Justice John Marshall, our Constitution is “intended to endure for ages to come,” and must adapt itself to a future “seen dimly,” if at all. . . . That is indeed why our Constitution is written as it is. The Framers (both in 1788 and 1868) understood that the world changes. So they did not define rights by reference to the specific practices existing at the time. Instead, the Framers defined rights in general terms, to permit future evolution in their scope and meaning. And over the course of our history, this Court has taken up the Framers’ invitation. It has kept true to the Framers’ principles by applying them in new ways, responsive to new societal understandings and conditions. . . .\n\nNowhere has that approach been more prevalent than in construing the majestic but open-ended words of the Fourteenth Amendment—the guarantees of “liberty” and “equality” for all.  And nowhere has that approach produced prouder moments, for this country and the Court.  Consider an example Obergefell used a few years ago.  The Court there confronted a claim . . . that the Fourteenth Amendment “must be defined in a most circumscribed manner, with central reference to specific historical practices”—exactly the view today’s majority follows. . . . And the Court specifically rejected that view.  In doing so, the Court reflected on what the proposed, historically circumscribed approach would have meant of interracial marriage.  The Fourteenth Amendment’s ratifiers did not think it gave black and white people a right to marry each other.  To the contrary, contemporaneous practice deemed that act quite as unprotected as abortion.  Yet the Court in Loving v. Virginia read the Fourteenth Amendment to embrace the Lovings’ union.  If, Obergefell explained, “rights were defined by who exercised them in the past, then received practices could serve as their own continued justification”—even when they conflict with “liberty” and “equality” as later and more broadly understood.  The Constitution does not freeze for all time the original view of what those rights guarantee, or how they apply.\n\nThat does not mean anything goes.  The majority wishes people to think there are but two alternatives: (1) accept the original applications of the Fourteenth Amendment and no others, or (2) surrender to judges’ “own ardent views,” ungrounded in law, about the liberty that Americans should enjoy.  . . . [A]pplications of liberty and equality can evolve while remaining grounded in constitutional principles, constitutional history, and constitutional precedents.  The second Justice Harlan discussed how to strike the right balance when he explained why he would have invalidated a State’s ban on contraceptive use.  Judges, he said, are not ‘free to roam where unguided speculation might take them. . . . Yet they also must recognize that the constitutional ‘tradition’ of this country is not captured whole at a single moment.  Rather, its meaning gains content from the long sweep of our history and from successive judicial precedents—each looking to the last and each seeking to apply the Constitution’s most fundamental commitments to new conditions.  That is why Americans . . . have a right to marry across racial lines.  And it is why, to go back to Justice Harlan’s case, Americans have a right to use contraceptives so they can choose for themselves whether to have children. . . .\n\nFaced with all these connections between Roe/Casey and judicial decisions recognizing other constitutional rights, the majority tells everyone not to worry. It can (so it says) neatly extract the right to choose from the constitutional edifice without affecting any associated rights. (Think of someone telling you that the Jenga tower simply will not collapse.). . . .\n\nAccording to the majority, no liberty interest is present [in the context of abortion]—because (and only because) the law offered no protection to the woman’s choice in the 19th century. But here is the rub. The law also did not then (and would not for ages) protect a wealth of other things. It did not protect the rights recognized in Lawrence and Obergefell to same-sex intimacy and marriage. It did not protect the right recognized in Loving to marry across racial lines. It did not protect the right recognized in Griswold to contraceptive use. For that matter, it did not protect the right . . . not to be sterilized without consent. So if the majority is right in its legal analysis, all those decisions were wrong, and all those matters properly belong to the States too—whatever the particular state interests involved. And if that is true, it is impossible to understand (as a matter of logic and principle) how the majority can say that its opinion today does not threaten—does not even “undermine”—any number of other constitutional rights.\n\nNor does it even help just to take the majority at its word. Assume the majority is sincere in saying, for whatever reason, that it will go so far and no further. Scout’s honor. Still, the future significance of today’s opinion will be decided in the future. And law often has a way of evolving without regard to original intentions—a way of actually following where logic leads, rather than tolerating hard-to-explain lines.\n\nBy overruling Roe, Casey, and more than 20 cases reaffirming or applying the constitutional right to abortion, the majority abandons stare decisis, a principle central to the rule of law.  [In previous cases overturning precedent,] the Court found, for example, (1) a change in legal doctrine that undermined or made obsolete the earlier decision; (2) a factual change that had the same effect; or (3) an absence of reliance because the earlier decision was less than a decade old. . . . None of those factors apply here: Nothing—and in particular, no significant legal or factual change—supports overturning a half-century of settled law giving women control over their reproductive lives.\n\nThe Court’s decision makes radical change too easy and too fast, based on nothing more than the new views of new judges.  The majority has overruled Roe and Casey for one and only one reason: because it has always despised them, and now it has the votes to discard them.  The majority thereby substitutes a rule by judges for the rule of law.\n\nThis Court will surely face critical question about how its new approach applies.  Must a state law allow abortions when necessary to protect a woman’s life and health?  And if so, exactly when?  How much risk to a woman’s life can a State force her to incur, before the Fourteenth Amendment’s protection of life kicks in?  Suppose a patient with pulmonary hypertension has a 30-to-50 percent risk of dying with ongoing pregnancy; is that enough?  And short of death, how much illness or injury can the State require her to accept, consistent with the Amendment’s protection of liberty and equality?  Further, the Court may face questions about the application of abortion regulations to medical care most people view as quite different from abortion.  What about the morning-after pill?  IUDs?  In vitro fertilization?  And how about the use of dilation and evacuation or medication for miscarriage management? . . .\n\nJustice Jackson once called a decision he dissented from Korematsu v. United States (1944) a “loaded weapon,” ready to hand for improper uses. . . . We fear that today’s decision, departing from stare decisis for no legitimate reason, is its own loaded weapon. Weakening stare decisis threatens to upend bedrock legal doctrines, far beyond any single decision. Weakening stare decisis creates profound legal instability. And as Casey recognized, weakening stare decisis in a hotly contested case like this one calls into question this Court’s commitment to legal principle. It makes the Court appear not restrained but aggressive, not modest but grasping. In all those ways, today’s decision takes aim, we fear, at the rule of law. . . .\n\nNow a new and bare majority of this Court—acting at practically the first moment possible—overrules Roe and Casey.  It converts a series of dissenting opinions expressing antipathy toward Roe and Casey into a decision greenlighting even total abortion bans.  It eliminates a 50-year-old constitutional right that safeguards women’s freedom and equal station.  It breaches a core rule-of-law principle, designed to promote constancy in the law.  In doing all of that, it places in jeopardy other rights, from contraception to same-sex intimacy and marriage.  And finally, it undermines the Court’s legitimacy. . . .\n\nWith sorrow—for this Court, but more, for the many millions of American women who have today lost a fundamental constitutional protection—we dissent.\n\nLegal case analysis\n\nThis case, which reshaped the legal landscape of abortion rights, is a landmark in American judicial history. Please read the case details and the court's decision process carefully.\n\n\n\nRoe v. Wade\n\n“We . . . conclude that the right of personal privacy includes the abortion decision, but that this right is not unqualified and must be considered against important state interests in regulation.”——Justice Harry Blackmun (Majority)\n\nSummary\n\nAt a time when Texas law restricted abortions except to save the life of the mother, Jane Roe (a single, pregnant woman) sued Henry Wade, the local district attorney tasked with enforcing the abortion statute. She argued that the Texas law was unconstitutional. The Supreme Court agreed, holding that the right of privacy, inherent in the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, protects a woman’s choice to have an abortion. That right is limited, however, as the pregnancy advances, by the State’s interest in maternal health and in fetal life after viability. Amid national debate over this issue, this was the first time the Court took up this question and affirmed the “right to choose,” as it is often titled.\n\nRead the Full Opinion\n\nExcerpt: Majority Opinion, Justice Harry Blackmun\n\nThe Constitution does not explicitly mention any right of privacy. In a line of decisions, however, . . . the Court has recognized that a right of personal privacy, or a guarantee of certain areas or zones of privacy, does exist under the Constitution. In varying contexts, the Court or individual Justices have, indeed, found at least the roots of that right in the First Amendment; in the Fourth and Fifth Amendments; in the penumbras of the Bill of Rights; in the Ninth Amendment; or in the concept of liberty guaranteed by the first section of the Fourteenth Amendment. These decisions make it clear that only personal rights that can be deemed ‘fundamental’ or ‘implicit in the concept of ordered liberty,’ are included in this guarantee of personal privacy. They also make it clear that the right has some extension to activities relating to marriage; procreation; contraception; family relationships; and child rearing and education.\n\nThis right of privacy, whether it be founded in the Fourteenth Amendment’s concept of personal liberty and restrictions upon state action, as we feel it is, or, as the District Court determined, in the Ninth Amendment’s reservation of rights to the people, is broad enough to encompass a woman’s decision whether or not to terminate her pregnancy. The detriment that the State would impose upon the pregnant woman by denying this choice altogether is apparent. Specific and direct harm medically diagnosable even in early pregnancy may be involved. Maternity, or additional offspring, may force upon the woman a distressful life and future. Psychological harm may be imminent. Mental and physical health may be taxed by child care. There is also the distress, for all concerned, associated with the unwanted child, and there is the problem of bringing a child into a family already unable, psychologically and otherwise, to care for it. In other cases, as in this one, the additional difficulties and continuing stigma of unwed motherhood may be involved. All these are factors the woman and her responsible physician necessarily will consider in consultation. . . .\n\nThe Court’s decisions recognizing a right of privacy also acknowledge that some state regulation in areas protected by that right is appropriate. [A] State may properly assert important interests in safeguarding health, in maintaining medical standards, and in protecting potential life. At some point in pregnancy, these respective interests become sufficiently compelling to sustain regulation of the factors that govern the abortion decision. The privacy right involved, therefore, cannot be said to be absolute. In fact, it is not clear to us that the claim . . .  that one has an unlimited right to do with one’s body as one pleases bears a close relationship to the right of privacy previously articulated in the Court’s decisions. The Court has refused to recognize an unlimited right of this kind in the past. \n\nWe, therefore, conclude that the right of personal privacy includes the abortion decision, but that this right is not unqualified and must be considered against important state interests in regulation.\n\nTo summarize and to repeat:\n\n1. A state criminal abortion statute of the current Texas type, that excepts from criminality only a lifesaving procedure on behalf of the mother, without regard to pregnancy stage and without recognition of the other interests involved, is violative of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\n(a) For the stage prior to approximately the end of the first trimester, the abortion decision and its effectuation must be left to the medical judgment of the pregnant woman’s attending physician.\n\n(b) For the stage subsequent to approximately the end of the first trimester, the State, in promoting its interest in the health of the mother, may, if it chooses, regulate the abortion procedure in ways that are reasonably related to maternal health.\n\n(c) For the stage subsequent to viability, the State in promoting its interest in the potentiality of human life may, if it chooses, regulate, and even proscribe, abortion except where it is necessary, in appropriate medical judgment, for the preservation of the life or health of the mother. . . .\n\nThis holding, we feel, is consistent with the relative weights of the respective interests involved, with the lessons and examples of medical and legal history, with the lenity of the common law, and with the demands of the profound problems of the present day. The decision leaves the State free to place increasing restrictions on abortion as the period of pregnancy lengthens, so long as those restrictions are tailored to the recognized state interests. The decision vindicates the right of the physician to administer medical treatment according to his professional judgment up to the points where important state interests provide compelling justifications for intervention. Up to those points, the abortion decision in all its aspects is inherently, and primarily, a medical decision, and basic responsibility for it must rest with the physician. . . .\n\nExcerpt: Dissent, Justice William Rehnquist\n\nThe Court’s opinion brings to the decision of this troubling question both extensive historical fact and a wealth of legal scholarship. While the opinion thus commands my respect, I find myself nonetheless in fundamental disagreement with those parts of it that invalidate the Texas statute in question, and therefore dissent. . . .\n\nI have difficulty in concluding, as the Court does, that the right of “privacy” is involved in this case. Texas, by the statute here challenged, bars the performance of a medical abortion by a licensed physician on a plaintiff such as Roe. A transaction resulting in an operation such as this is not ‘private’ in the ordinary usage of that word. Nor is the ‘privacy’ that the Court finds here even a distant relative of the freedom from searches and seizures protected by the Fourth Amendment to the Constitution, which the Court has referred to as embodying a right to privacy.\n\nIf the Court means by the term “privacy” no more than that the claim of a person to be free from unwanted state regulation of consensual transactions may be a form of “liberty” protected by the Fourteenth Amendment, there is no doubt that similar claims have been upheld in our earlier decisions on the basis of that liberty. I agree with the statement of MR. JUSTICE STEWART in his concurring opinion that the “liberty,” against deprivation of which without due process the Fourteenth Amendment protects, embraces more than the rights found in the Bill of Rights. But that liberty is not guaranteed absolutely against deprivation, only against deprivation without due process of law. The test traditionally applied in the area of social and economic legislation is whether or not a law such as that challenged has a rational relation to a valid state objective. . . . The Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment undoubtedly does place a limit, albeit a broad one, on legislative power to enact laws such as this. If the Texas statute were to prohibit an abortion even where the mother’s life is in jeopardy, I have little doubt that such a statute would lack a rational relation to a valid state objective . . . . But the Court’s sweeping invalidation of any restrictions on abortion during the first trimester is impossible to justify under that standard, and the conscious weighing of competing factors that the Court’s opinion apparently substitutes for the established test is far more appropriate to a legislative judgment than to a judicial one. . . .\n\nThe fact that a majority of the States reflecting, after all the majority sentiment in those States, have had restrictions on abortions for at least a century is a strong indication, it seems to me, that the asserted right to an abortion is not ‘so rooted in the traditions and conscience of our people as to be ranked as fundamental.’ Even today, when society’s views on abortion are changing, the very existence of the debate is evidence that the ‘right’ to an abortion is not so universally accepted as the appellant would have us believe.\n\nTo reach its result, the Court necessarily has had to find within the scope of the Fourteenth Amendment a right that was apparently completely unknown to the drafters of the Amendment. As early as 1821, the first state law dealing directly with abortion was enacted by the Connecticut Legislature. . . . By the time of the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment in 1868, there were at least 36 laws enacted by state or territorial legislatures limiting abortion. While many States have amended or updated their laws, 21 of the laws on the books in 1868 remain in effect today. Indeed, the Texas statute struck down today was, as the majority notes, first enacted in 1857, and “has remained substantially unchanged to the present time.” . . .\n\nThere apparently was no question concerning the validity of this provision or of any of the other state statutes when the Fourteenth Amendment was adopted. The only conclusion possible from this history is that the drafters did not intend to have the Fourteenth Amendment withdraw from the States the power to legislate with respect to this matter. . . ."

Section 1 Article 4(1) of the Ethical Principles for Human Reproductive Technologies and Human Sperm Banks explicitly stipulates that ‘couples who do not comply with national population and family planning laws and regulations and single women’ are prohibited from accessing ARTs. However, unmarried men are allowed to freeze sperm regardless of their marital status, constituting direct discrimination against women. Furthermore, significant legislative conflicts exist between local regulations and departmental rules in this area, hindering the consistent application of ART norms in China and substantially limiting the reproductive rights of Chinese women. Zaozao Xu’s case is the first case in China directly challenging the current prohibitive regulations on egg freezing and may signify a crucial turning point in China’s reform of ARTs legislation. This commentary provides an overview of the case and examines various issues associated with the existing regulatory framework, including the vagueness of the legislation and regulation, legislative conflicts in the current framework, deeply rooted discrimination against women, and the regulator’s problematic conception of ARTs. This commentary emphasises the urgent need for China to re-evaluate and reform its ARTs regulatory framework to allow unmarried women to access ARTs, or at least egg-freezing services as the first step.\n\nKeywords: Assisted reproductive technologies, egg freezing, unmarried women’s reproductive rights,legislative conflicts,discrimination against women\n\n\n\nIntroduction\n\nAlthough practised with increasing success since the birth of the first Chinese IVF baby Mengzhu Zheng in 1988, assisted reproductive technologies (henceforth ARTs) were not regulated in China’s Mainland until 2001. Due to potential ethical, cultural, and public health concerns, China has historically maintained strict regulations regarding the application of ARTs. Notably, unmarried women have always been and are still prohibited from accessing any ARTs, including egg freezing in China. It has been claimed that the legislation was drafted on the basis of principles and reasoning relating to safeguarding public interests and maintaining ethical standards. However, recently, this prohibition has been challenged in court.\n\nIn 2019, Zaozao Xu, an unmarried Chinese woman, brought a case to the Chaoyang District People’s Court in Beijing (henceforth the District Court) after being refused access to egg freezing at the Beijing Obstetrics and Gynaecology Hospital Affiliated with Capital Medical University (henceforth ‘the Hospital’). Xu maintained that the Hospital’s refusal to provide egg-freezing services for her constituted violations of her general personality rights. The District Court ruled that the Hospital’s refusal did not violate Xu’s rights. Xu appealed. Appeal officially began in Beijing No. 3 Intermediate Court in May 2023, and the appellate court has not yet reached a decision. Given the current regulations on ARTs, the final outcome of Xu’s appeal is likely to be the same as the decision reached in the District Court. Nevertheless, this case is important as it is the first in which an unmarried woman has challenged the current regulatory framework of ARTs, especially the Rules governing egg freezing in China.\n\nIn this commentary, we reflect on the implications of this case for egg-freezing services and other forms of ARTs. First, we set out the relevant facts of Xu’s case and the key points raised by the trial court. Second, we reflect on the intersection between the regulatory governance of ARTs and other areas of law pertaining to the protection of procreative rights of women, in particular those of unmarried women. Finally, we argue that Xu’s case exemplifies the urgency of reforming the current legislation and regulation in China to allow unmarried women to access ARTs, at least egg-freezing services and to equally exercise their reproductive rights in due course.\n\n\n\nFacts and legal process\n\nIn 2018, a 30-year-old unmarried woman (Xu) sought egg-freezing services at the Hospital. After undergoing various health checks, the results showed that her physical condition was suitable for undergoing egg-freezing treatment. However, the Hospital refused her request due to her marital status as unmarried. Xu was not happy with the rejection. After consulting with legal experts, Xu brought a case against the Hospital arguing that her general personality rights have been unduly infringed by such refusal. On 23 December 2019, the District Court heard this case. During the trial, both parties presented their cases, and the court conducted a session of evidence presentation and cross-examination. After the first hearing, the court held that the case involved so many issues such as medical law and ethics, public policy, and egg-freezing technology that it could not reach a decision on the day and decided to adjourn the case.\n\nOn 17 September 2021, the District Court conducted another hearing and announced that a judgement would be issued later. On 22 July 2022, the court dismissed Xu’s entire claim and held that the Administrative Measures for Human Assisted Reproductive Technologies  (henceforth the Administrative Measures for ARTs) clearly stipulates that the application of ARTs must be for ‘medical purposes’ and comply with the state’s birth planning policies. The Hospital must have reached its decision while taking into account factors such as her diagnosis, and treatment in question, and the relevant laws, regulations, and rules. Moreover, Section 1 Article 4(1) of the Ethical Principles for Human Reproductive Technologies and Human Sperm Banks  (henceforth the Ethical Principles) explicitly stipulates that ‘couples who do not comply with national population and family planning laws and regulations and single women’ are prohibited from accessing ARTs. It follows that Xu, as an unmarried woman, was seen as a single woman in law and that she failed to satisfy the requirements set out in the Ethical Principles to receive egg-freezing services. Therefore, the District Court found that the hospital’s refusal in providing egg-freezing services for Xu did not constitute a violation of law and an infringement on her general personality rights.\n\nFollowing the widespread media coverage of this case, the topic of unmarried women’s reproductive rights in China has sparked widespread debate. After the District Court had found in favour of the Hospital, Xu filed an appeal to Beijing No. 3 Intermediate People’s Court (henceforth the Intermediate Court). In the afternoon of 9 May 2023, Xu’s appeal was heard by the Intermediate Court. Xu applied for expert witnesses to testify their views on medical ethics and supplemented her case with public opinions, local policies, and her recent physical examination reports. The Hospital maintained that protecting reproductive rights should start from age-appropriate fertility rather than delaying fertility. The Intermediate Court has yet to rule the case. It remains to be seen how it will ultimately decide and reason this case. It should be noted that Xu will have no further right to appeal if she loses again. However, under the Civil Procedure Law 2021, she may apply for a retrial under the procedure for trial supervision if she can establish a case satisfying one of the criteria laid down in Article 207 of the Civil Procedure Law 2021.\n\n\n\nThe Law\n\nGeneral background of the Chinese legal system\n\nIn order to understand the legal regime governing ARTs in China, it is necessary to have some background information and knowledge about the Chinese legal system. The Legislation Law of the People’s Republic of China, which was promulgated in 2000 and has been recently revised in 2023 clarifies the categories of formal legislation and corresponding authorities in China. Under the Legislation Law framework, the National People’s Congress (henceforth NPC) as the national legislator adopts basic laws (laws governing criminal offences, civil affairs, state organs, and other matters) and (other) laws. The Standing Committee of the NPC (henceforth NPCSC) adopts laws  and may supplement or amend laws adopted by the NPC. The State Council (henceforth SC) adopts administrative regulations , and the SC ministries and commissions as well as provincial-level people’s governments issue rules. The people’s congresses of provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the Central Government, and the standing committees of these people’s congresses adopt local regulations ; autonomous regions adopt autonomous regulations or separate regulations ; special economic zones adopt regulations.\n\nChapter V of the Legislation Law clarifies China’s legislative hierarchy. Article 98 declares that the Constitution possesses the highest legal effect. The legal effect of laws is higher than that of administrative regulations, local regulations, and rules, and the legal force of administrative regulations is higher than that of local regulations and rules. The legal effect of local regulations is higher than that of the local government rules at or below the same level, and the legal effect of the rules issued by provincial-level governments is higher than that of the rules issued by districted cities or autonomous prefectures within their administrative region. Finally, departmental rules and local governmental rules have the same legal status.\n\nThe types of legislation that are concerned in the area of ARTs include departmental rules issued by the former Ministry of Health (now the National Health Commission, henceforth NHC), the local regulations issued by the people’s congresses, especially the People’s Congress of Jilin Province, and a number of laws in relevant areas, which will be explored and examined in detail below.\n\n\n\nThe rules governing ARTs in China\n\nIn February 2001, the former Ministry of Health issued two departmental rules: the Administrative Measures for Human Assisted Reproductive Technologies  and the Administrative Measures for Human Sperm Banks . In the same year, the former Ministry of Health, issued another four departmental rules in May, including the Technical Specifications for Human Reproductive Technologies , the Basic Standards for Human Sperm Banks , the Technical Specifications for Human Sperm Banks , and the Ethical Principles for Performing Human Reproductive Technologies  in May 2001.\n\nHowever, the four Rules published in May 2001 were all abolished in 2003. Instead, the former Ministry of Health codified those old departmental rules into three new departmental rules, namely, the Technical Specifications for Human Reproductive Technologies , the Basic Standards and the Technical Specifications for Human Sperm Banks , and the Ethical Principles for Human Reproductive Technologies and Human Sperm Banks (henceforth the Ethical Principles).\n\nThese five departmental rules, including the two published in February 2001 and three published in 2003, are the only national legal norms governing ARTs in China. It should be noted that it has been more than 20 years since those Departmental Rules were drafted and reviewed. Technologies have advanced, and success rates have also soared in that time. However, so far, there still has been no national law passed to regulate ARTs. Most importantly, women, particularly unmarried women, have always experienced great obstacles to access ARTs in China, leading to the main argument that the current regulatory framework on ARTs urgently needs to be reformed.\n\n\n\nThe need for a reform\n\nThe vagueness of the regulations\n\nWhen we have a closer look at the regulations surrounding Xu’s case, the first point that deserves attention is Section 1 Article 3 of the Administrative Measures for ARTs, which clearly states that the application of ARTs should only be ‘carried out in medical institutions’ and ‘for medical purposes’. However, what amounts to ‘medical purposes’ is not defined or explained in the legislation, allowing latitude to restrict access to ARTs. The interpretation of ‘medical purposes’ directly bears on whether aims such as the preservation of fertility and promotion of physical and mental well-being fall within the scope of the Administrative Measures. In Xu’s Case, the District Court used a rather narrow approach, interpreting ‘medical purposes’ to only include treating diseases such as infertility. The District Court believed that Xu’s reason for accessing egg freezing was to preserve her eggs and to allow her to conceive a biologically related child at a later and preferred age. In the eyes of the District Court, this failed to constitute a ‘medical purpose’, and Xu’s decision to access egg freezing was made on a ‘social’ rather than on a ‘medical’ basis. Therefore, failure to have a proper ‘medical purpose’ was used by the District Court as one of the important reasons for denying Xu’s claims.\n\n\n\nThe current framework constitutes state-authorised discrimination against women\n\nSection 1 Article 4(1) of the Ethical Principles directly stipulates that couples who do not comply with national population and family planning laws and regulations and unmarried women are prohibited from accessing ARTs, and this also constitutes part of the code of conduct for medical personnel when carrying out any ARTs procedures. By disallowing unmarried women to access any form of ARTs, this constitutes a substantial restriction and obstacle to the rights of women to freely decide whether, when, and with whom to give birth and found a family.\n\nFurthermore, following Section 1 Article 3 of the Administrative Measures for ARTs, sperm freezing should have also been restricted to married men, but Section 2 Article 2(2) of the Basic Standards allows men to freeze their sperm irrespective of their marital status. Such relaxation on sperm freezing has inevitably led to questions of sexism and discrimination. Why can unmarried men freeze their sperm whenever they feel like doing so, whereas unmarried women can only do so after getting married? Do such provisions constitute direct state-authorised discrimination against women, especially the unmarried ones? Looking at the language and the effects of the current regulatory framework, the answer is, certainly, yes. Within the group of unmarried persons, only men are allowed to freely choose when to exercise their procreative rights and delay reproduction by freezing their sperm. In the eyes of the regulator, unmarried women should not and cannot freeze their eggs to delay parenthood like unmarried men. Such Rules, undoubtedly and bluntly, have infringed the principle of equality as well as one of the most basic fundamental rights of women–the right to found a family. Such discriminatory regulations not only fail to protect and facilitate the reproductive rights of women but also create several legislative conflicts, which will now be explored.\n\n\n\nThe legislative conflicts\n\nFirst, there is a clear conflict between those departmental rules and their superior laws.The Constitution 2018, the Civil Code 2020, the Law on the Protection of the Right and Interests of Women 2022, and the Population and Family Planning Law 2021 do not distinguish between the protection afforded to married women and unmarried women, and at least in those laws, unmarried women do not receive a weaker level of protection of their rights just because of their marital status.\n\nSince egg freezing naturally belongs to the content of the reproductive rights of women and those rights are guaranteed by those laws to all women, it should be said that women, regardless of their marital status, should be able to access egg freezing and other forms of ARTs legally because their reproductive rights under those laws encompass such access. Clearly, those Departmental Rules directly contravene the protection of women’s reproductive rights as laid down in the laws. In principle, such conflict between the laws and departmental rules would have naturally invalidated the departmental rules as an inferior type of legislation to the laws. However, in practice, the departmental rules may still be in force and can be enforced regardless of the legislative conflict between the laws and them. As all the aforementioned laws and the Constitution have only been revised very recently, the NPC and NPCSC chose to ignore or failed to recognise and acknowledge the existence of such legislative conflict. Also, courts in China cannot invalidate departmental rules due to a conflict with their superior laws. Nor can the people’s courts declare a piece of legislation to be unconstitutional and invalidate it due to the limited power and jurisdiction that they enjoy in theory and in practice and the non-justiciable nature of the Constitution. As a result, these legislative conflicts remain unrecognised and unresolved, leading to an awkward fact that those Departmental Rules are legally enforceable, so are the laws.\n\nSecond, there is a clear legislative conflict between a local regulation and those Departmental Rules. Apart from the department rules, local regulations in different provinces also play a vital role in regulating ARTs in their respective jurisdictions. Interestingly, under Article 30 of the Regulation of Jilin Province on Population and Family Planning 2002 (henceforth the Jilin Regulation), unmarried women could access ARTs. Article 30 was the first and the only attempt, so far, in China, to grant unmarried women the right to access ARTs. When the Jilin Regulation was sent to the former National Family Planning Commission (was then a department of the SC but now part of the NHC) for filing, the National Family Planning Committee explicitly expressed their strong willingness to delete Article 30. Nevertheless, the Jilin People’s Congress decided to keep Article 30, notwithstanding that Article 30 directly and vividly contradicted the basic state policy of ‘one child policy’ and the Departmental Rules issued by the former Ministry of Health.\n\nIt should be noted that Article 30 did not allow all unmarried women across China to access ARTs in Jilin, but only the ones who have hukou in Jilin to legally access ARTs in Jilin fertility clinics. Hukou is a system of household registration in China, and it is an essential document for Chinese citizens to establish identity. People without hukou would find it extremely hard to establish eligibility for going to school, getting a job, and applying a passport. Hukou in China is very much like the immigration system in many other countries through which you can acquire rights such as the right to reside and the right to work through investing in a local business, buying a property, having a degree, holding a qualified job, or having been born in a family in which the mother and/or the father has the local hukou. And in this case, only the unmarried women with their hukou being registered in Jilin Province could, in theory, access ARTs. However, due to the inconsistency between the Departmental Rules and the Jilin Regulation (which have the same level of legal force) as well as the lack of clear guidance from national and local health bureaus, fertility clinics in Jilin would still refuse unmarried women to access ARTs in practice.\n\nNotably, the People’s Congress of Jilin Province amended the 2002 Jilin Regulation in 2004, 2011, 2014, 2016, and 2021. Yet today, notwithstanding the conflict between the Jilin Regulation and the Rules issued by the former Ministry of Health, the Jilin Regulation has not been amended or annulled by the NPCSC, and it is still in force, so is Article 29 of the 2021 Jilin Regulation, which allows unmarried women in Jilin to access ARTs. Many scholars have argued that the Jilin Regulation has gone too far and is not compatible with China’s family planning policies. However, it should be pointed out that the Jilin Regulation constitutes a major step forward in the protection of reproductive rights, albeit one that has been the subject of great controversy.\n\nThe important question to be asked here is how to resolve those legislative conflicts and provide clear guidance for fertility clinics in Jilin. Where two effective legislative provisions conflict, Chapter V of the Legislation Law 2023 provides a clear hierarchy of legislation and rules for applying legislation. However, it is not sufficiently clear as to the legal effectiveness of the legislative provisions in the event of conflict or inconsistency between local regulations and the rules of SC ministries. Under such circumstances, the SC makes a recommendation. If the SC finds the local rule should be applied, then the local rule shall be applied in its local jurisdiction (i.e. Jilin Province); if the SC recommends prioritising the Departmental Rule, it will be up to the NPCSC to decide which legislation should be applied. Unfortunately, the legislative conflict between the Jilin Regulation and the Departmental Rules has yet to attract the attention of the SC and the NPCSC, and therefore, the inconsistency remains. Since the internal incoherence of legislation is so apparent, the national legislature – NPC or its Standing Committee – should find a way to resolve those conflicts and evaluate the possibility of potential reform of the current framework on ARTs.\n\n\n\nThe regulator’s problematic conception of ARTs\n\nAccess to ARTs raises not only legal but moral, ethical, and societal questions. Unlike many other countries, religious reasons are not one of the main concerns for regulating fertility, including ARTs in China. Instead, social, cultural, and legal reasons are the primary reasons why there is still a national blanket ban on allowing unmarried women to access ARTs.\n\nSome members of the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference (hence-forth CPPCC) have asked the NHC if it is possible to relax the current blanket ban and allow unmarried women to access egg freezing. It is clear from the NHC’s official Reply that the true rationale behind the blanket ban is the fear of destruction of traditional family units, the emergence and the rise of complex family law matters after allowing unmarried women to have babies before marriage, and ultimately the damage or destruction of so-called social stability. All of these reasons are hidden under the disguise of preventing bodily harm to unmarried women due to long-term hormonal treatment caused by the egg-freezing procedure.\n\nIndeed, the process of getting any ART treatment is far more burdensome for women than men. Women must bear the discomfort or long-term impact on their bodies and fertility as a result of intensive hormonal treatment, whereas men barely need to go through any discomfort or encounter any long-term impact. However, if what NHC has claimed is really the case that ARTs are harmful for unmarried women’s bodies to the extent that they should be banned from accessing such services for the sake of protecting their own health, then ARTs should not be allowed for any women to access, including the married ones. Instead, the current regulatory framework seems to suggest that ARTs only cause harm to unmarried women, not to the married ones or not as significantly as to the married ones, as if marriage could shield married women from being harmed by ARTs.\n\nClearly, the national and provincial regulators in many cases have behaved as if they were regulating ARTs on the basis of medical science. However, in fact, the regulators only have given the appearance of regulating ARTs based on medical science, when they have been regulating on the grounds of political and social reasons. Many of them have ignored everything but the main political agendas, such as social stability and strong emphasis on the traditional form of families. The regulator, over the past decades, has created many obstacles for women to access ARTs, and in doing so, it essentially created risks for pushing women to go to the underground market to pursue such treatment. Moreover, the greater health risks caused by ART procedures should have given women a stronger interest than any other persons in making decisions surrounding ARTs and their fertility. However, the patriarchal values that are deeply rooted in the law-making culture direct the decision-making power to the men, who can freely decide whether and when to access ARTs to preserve their sperms and delay their reproduction to a preferred timing, instead of the women who, in fact, have more interests in claiming such decision-making power to decide what should be done to their bodies.\n\n\n\nConclusion\n\nXu’s case provides a vivid depiction of the problems existing in the current regulatory framework on ARTs and highlights the urgency of amending and potentially reforming the ARTs framework to allow unmarried women to access ARTs. By denying unmarried women’s right to freeze their eggs, this has actively constituted violation and infringement of their reproductive rights, and this should no longer be overlooked by the legislator and the regulator, and it is the time to re-examine the current framework on ARTs and reform it in due course.\n\nFurthermore, procreation is fundamental to the very existence and survival of the human race. The desires and reasons for wishing to have children do not differ according to a person’s marital status, sexual orientation, or gender identity. More importantly, there is no sound basis to conclude that marital status, gender identity, or sexual orientation can impact a person’s reproductive interests. Unmarried persons or couples may have the same wish to have genetically related children. Therefore, it is important to at least start considering reforming the current discriminatory regulatory regime and stopping denying unmarried women from accessing ARTs. At least, it can be started by allowing unmarried women to legally access egg-freezing services in China.\n\nAnalysis of legal article\n\n\n\nEquality and choice: sex equality perspectives on reproductive rights in the work of Ruth Bader Ginsburg\n\n“My mother told me two things constantly. One was to be a lady, and the other was to be independent. The study of law was unusual for my generation. For most girls growing up in the Forties, the most important degree was not your B.A. but your M.R.S.”—— Ruth Bader Ginsburg\n\nNot only the sex discrimination cases, but the cases on contraception, abortion, and illegitimacy as well, present various faces of a single issue: the roles women are to play in society. Are women to have the opportunity to participate in full partnership with men in the nation’s social, political, and economic life? This is a constitutional issue, ... surely one of the most important in this final quarter of the twentieth century.\n\nRuth Bader Ginsburg, 1978\n\nThis brief essay explores the sex-equality perspective on reproductive rights that Ruth Bader Ginsburg has articulated over four decades as lawyer, law professor, judge, and Justice. Throughout her career, Ginsburg has viewed laws that deprive women of control over whether and when they bear children as raising questions of equality, as well as liberty and privacy. Ginsburg and other feminists of the 1970s argued that, given the social organization of caregiving work, the state may not deprive women of control over the decision to become mothers without depriving them of equal citizenship.\n\nOver the decades, United States constitutional law has slowly responded to Ginsburg and the movement she helped lead, initially resisting sex-equality claims for reproductive choice, and then partly internalizing these values. Sex-equality reasoning about reproduction now informs the constitutional law of abortion and shapes legislated approaches to pregnancy discrimination, yet plays little role in doctrines protecting women’s access to contraception. Sex equality reasoning about reproduction is at the center of the Court’s holding in Nevada Department of Human Resources v. Hibbs that Congress had power under the Fourteenth Amendment to enact the family leave provisions of the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA), yet is wholly absent in the plurality and concurring opinions in Coleman v. Court of Appeals of Maryland that Congress lacked power under the Fourteenth Amendment to enact the self-care provisions of the FMLA--a judgment from which Justice Ginsburg dissented passionately and at length.\n\nI. As an ACLU Lawyer: Struck v. Secretary of Defenses\n\nFrom the beginning, Justice Ginsburg understood government regulation of women’s reproductive choices as presenting core questions of sex equality. One of Ginsburg’s earliest Supreme Court briefs for the ACLU, filed in Struck v. Secretary of Defense, advanced the cause of a woman who had been forcibly discharged from the Air Force because she was pregnant. Under then-prevailing government policy, new mothers could not serve in the armed services, while new fathers could; a pregnant service woman could avoid discharge only if she aborted the pregnancy.\n\nAs Justice Ginsburg recently recalled:\n\nThe ACLU had taken on, along with Struck, several other cases challenging the rule, then maintained by all the Armed Forces, requiring pregnant service members to choose between abortion and ouster from the military. But Captain Struck’s case was our frontrunner. We aimed to present the issue of reproductive choice through her eyes and experience. Captain Struck chose birth, but her Government made that choice a mandatory ground for discharge.\n\nGinsburg’s merits brief challenged Struck’s exclusion from military service on equal protection and due process privacy grounds. Ultimately, the government would change its policy with the aim of mooting Struck’s case.\n\nGinsburg’s 1972 brief argued that Struck’s discharge for pregnancy violated the Equal Protection Clause. The brief appeals to several conceptually distinct understandings of equality, which together interact to produce a compelling argument for sex equality in the regulation of women’s reproductive choices:\n\nA. The familiar demand for equal treatment: In the Struck brief, Ginsburg argued that mandatory discharge from the military for mothers-to-be, but not fathers-to-be, enforced a double standard in matters of sex and family roles. As the brief wryly observed, unlike women in the Air Force, “[m]en in the Air Force are not constrained to avoid the pleasures and responsibilities of procreation and parenthood.”\n\nB. The anti-stereotyping principle: Ginsburg’s equal protection argument objected to different treatment, and something more. It challenged (1) government imposition of (2) traditional, stereotypical sex roles on men and women. Ginsburg argued, “Mandatory pregnancy discharge reinforces societal pressure [on women] to relinquish career aspirations for a hearth-centered existence.” Air Force policy enforced the “discredited notion that a woman who becomes pregnant is not fit for duty, but should be confined at home to await childbirth and thereafter devote herself to child care.” As the quoted passages illustrate, the brief’s challenge to state-imposed sex roles was especially concerned with legal imposition of the breadwinner/caregiver family roles historically associated with the separate spheres tradition.\n\nC. The anti-subordination principle: The Struck brief characterized the harm of government-imposed sex roles in the language of subordination. Ginsburg argued that the law's “[p]resumably well-meaning exaltation of women's unique role in bearing children has, in effect, denied women equal opportunity to develop their individual talents and capacities and has impelled them to accept a dependent, subordinate status in society.\" The harm described here is dignitary as well as material: the law denies women the capacity to lead autonomous self-governing lives, and instead imposes on women, as a group, a dependent subordinate status.\n\nAnother groundbreaking aspect of the Struck brief is the way it connects liberty and equality. Most simply, the brief connects liberty and equality in challenging the Air Force policy by appealing to the equal protection and substantive due process components of the Fifth Amendment's Due Process Clause. But the brief does not simply challenge the Air Force policy on two different constitutional grounds; it shows how each constitutional concern implicates the other. The brief demonstrates how practices that deny women equal treatment limit their freedom, and how practices that constrain women's liberty deny women equality. A recurring theme of the brief is that laws that stereotype--that constrain women's freedom in the choice of social roles--deprive women of equal citizenship. In so arguing, Ginsburg was giving early and especially forceful legal expression to equality arguments for reproductive rights advanced by feminists as they joined the campaign in the early 1970s to repeal abortion restrictions.\n\nII. Over the Decades: As a Professor and Judge\n\nGinsburg's 1972 brief in Struck opened themes she would pursue as an advocate, as a professor, as an appellate judge, and as a Supreme Court justice. From the very beginning, Ginsburg saw regulation constraining women's reproductive choices as presenting equal protection questions. And from the very beginning, the United States Supreme Court resisted the claims of the women's movement that the regulation of women's reproductive lives should be analyzed in an equal protection framework. In 1974, the Supreme Court ruled in Geduldig v. Aiello (a movement case litigated by Wendy Williams) that exclusion of pregnancy from a comprehensive disability benefits program did not violate the Equal Protection Clause because discrimination on the basis of pregnancy was not necessarily “discrimination based upon gender as such.” Professor Ginsburg objected, in exasperation, in the 1975 Supreme Court Review: “Is the answer that pregnancy can't happen to man, therefore pregnancy classifications can't discriminate on the basis of sex? Or because they affect women exclusively do pregnancy classifications merit particularly careful inspection?” She then emphasized: “Discussed at length in Appellees' brief were the stereotypical attitudes and generalizations about sex roles in society underlying disadvantageous job-related treatment of pregnant women.”\n\nIn a series of papers published in 1978 after Kenneth Karst's groundbreaking Harvard Law Review Foreword, Professor Ginsburg further raised the stakes, insisting that the Court was misapprehending the sex-role logic of laws that excluded pregnant employees from work and that criminalized women's access to contraception and abortion:\n\nThe High Court has not yet perceived the full dimension of current controversy surrounding gender-based discrimination.... Not only the Sex discrimination cases, but the cases on contraception, abortion, and illegitimacy as well, present various faces of a single issue: the roles women are to play in society. Are women to have the.opportunity.to participate in full partnership with men in the nation's social, political, and economic life? This is ad constitutional issue, Professor Karst underscored, surely one of the most important in this final quarter of the twentieth century.\n\nGinsburg was concerned about the Court's failure to recognize that there was textual authority for the movement's constitutional claims--the Court's failure to base its decisions about contraception and abortion on the Equal Protection Clause. But she was also concerned about the Court's grasp of the social concerns at stake in the regulation of contraception and abortion, the Court's inability to appreciate that laws criminalizing contraception and abortion define the roles women are to play in society.\n\nProfessor Ginsburg continued: Unlike Professor Karst, the Supreme Court either does not see, or is unwilling to acknowledge, all of these cases as part and parcel of a single large issue. Precedent to date generally places explicit gender-based differentials, illegitimacy, pregnancy, and abortion in separate cubbyholes. Roe v. Wade and Doe v. Bolton, the 1973 abortion decisions, for example, barely mention women's rights. They are not tied to equal protection or equal rights theory. Rather, the Supreme Court anchored stringent review to concepts of personal privacy or autonomy derived from the due process guarantee. Prof. Laurence Tribe pointed out that nothing in the Supreme Court analysis in Roe v. Wade and Doe v. Bolion tumed on the sex specific impact of abortion restrictions. A broader frame for these decisions might have made it more difficult for the Court to rule, as it did stunningly in June 1977, that neither the Constitution nor federal statute requires medicaid reimbursement for elective abortions.\n\nIn the Tulane Law Review later that year, she observed: Eventually, the Court may take abortion, pregnancy, out-of-wedlock birth, and explicit gender-based differentials out of the separate cubbyholes in which they now rest, acknowledge the practical interrelationships, and treat these matters as part and parcel of a single, large, sex equality issue. That synthesis perhaps depends on clearer directions from the political arena, but it seems a likely candidate for 1980’s development.\n\nBut something else happened instead, dynamics that Susan Faludi memorably termed \"backlash.\" By the late 1970s, evangelical Protestants began to join conservative Catholics in attacking Roe. These and other developments led Phyllis Schlafly to focus her campaign against the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA) on the claim that the ERA would constitutionalize abortion and same-sex marriage. In response, many feminist advocates sought to disassociate abortion and equality during the last years of the ratification campaign-a strategy that Professor Ginsburg appears at least indirectly to have supported.\n\nIn 1980, the year of Ginsburg's nomination by President Carter to the federal bench, Ronald Reagan was elected on a Republican platform that promised to appoint judges \"who respect traditional family values and the sanctity of innocent human life.\" (Note how the platform attacks the ERA and abortion and associates \"pro-family\"and \"prolife\"values.) The time for ratification of the ERA expired and through twelve years of conservative governance, the composition of the federal bench began fatefully to change.\n\nAs a sitting federal judge in the 1980s and 1990s, Ginsburg lamented the Court's failure to ground the abortion right in sex equality. As she put it in 1985:\n\nThe Court's Roe position is weakened, I believe, by the opinion's concentration on a medically approved autonomy idea, to the exclusion of a constitutionally based sex-equality perspective. I understand the view that for political reasons the reproductive autonomy controversy should be isolated from the general debate on equal rights, responsibilities, and opportunities for women and men. I expect, however, that organized and determined opposing efforts to inform and persuade the public on the abortion issue will continue through the 1980s. In that process there will be opportunities for elaborating in public forums the equal-regard conception of women's claims to reproductive choice uncoerced and unsteered by government.\n\nWith prospects for renewing the ERA campaign receding, feminists became more vocal in advancing equality arguments for reproductive freedom.While discussing the Struck case during her Supreme Court confirmation hearing in 1993, Judge Ginsburg was asked by Senator Hank Brown whether the equality reasoning extended to abortion, as well. Ginsburg answered:\n\nYou asked me about my thinking about equal protection versus individual autonomy, and my answer to you is it's both. This is something central to a woman's life, to her dignity. It's a decision that she must make for herself. And when Government controls that decision for her, she's being treated as less than a fully adult human responsible for her own choices.\n\nIII. Reproductive Rights in the Supreme Court\n\nHas United States law responded to the equality claims for reproductive rights that Justice Ginsburg and the United States women's movement have been making since the early 1970s? Roe scarcely acknowledges feminist arguments of the era. The feminist arguments associating abortion and sex equality are more legible in the campaign against the ERA, where opponents invoked the association as reason to oppose ratification.\n\nYet by the 1980s, the Supreme Court decisions concerning abortion quietly began to incorporate feminist equality claims for reproductive rights. In 1986, Justice Blackmun concluded Thornburgh v. American College of Obstetricians & Gynecologists by rejecting legislation seeking to narrow the abortion right, writing:\n\nFew decisions are more personal and intimate, more properly private, or more basic to individual dignity and autonomy, than a woman's decision— with the guidance of her physician and within the limits specified in Roe-whether to end her pregnancy. A woman's right to make that choice freely is fundamental. Any other result, in our view, would protect inadequately a central part of the sphere of liberty that our law guarantees equally to all.\n\nIn the last words of his opinion, Justice Blackman emphasized that the abortion right concerned equality as well as autonomy: women's equal freedom with men to be self-governing.\n\nIn the Supreme Court's 1992 decision in Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania v. Casey, (43) the Court reaffirmed, while significantly narrowing, the abortion right, in a decision that repeatedly reasoned about the abortion right as respecting women's equality.\n\nThe portion of the plurality opinion attributed to Justice Kennedy invoked dignity to explain why the Constitution protects decisions regarding family life: \"These matters, involving the most intimate and personal choices a person may make in a lifetime, choices central to personal dignity and autonomy, are central to the liberty protected by the Fourteenth Amendment.\" (44) Kennedy explained that the State could not impose \"its own vision of the woman's role, however dominant that vision has been in the course of our history and our culture.\" (45) This is a sex equality understanding of dignity, resonant with themes that Ginsburg as a lawyer, professor, judge, and Justice wove through the Court's equal protection sex discrimination cases. The joint opinion recognized that \"the ability of women to participate equally in the economic and social life of the Nation has been facilitated by their ability to control their reproductive lives.\" (46) The joint opinion's invalidation of spousal notification requirements similarly invoked sex equality principles, which it associated with freedom from laws enforcing traditional gender roles in the family. (47) As I have elsewhere written, the joint opinion expressed \"constitutional limitations on abortion laws in the language of its equal protection sex discrimination opinions, illuminating liberty concerns at the heart of the sex equality cases in the very act of recognizing equality concerns at the root of the liberty cases.\" (48)\n\nDespite the sex equality reasoning threading through Casey's due process analysis, the Court has never done what Justice Ginsburg imagined: taken \"abortion, pregnancy, out-of-wedlock  birth, and explicit gender-based differentials out of the separate cubbyholes in which they now  rest, acknowledge[d] the practical interrelationships, and treat[ed] these matters as part and parcel of a single, large, sex equality issue.\" (49)\n\nThat was terrain for Justice Ginsburg to cross in her 2007 dissent, joined by three other Justices, in Gonzales v. Carhart, (50) the so-called partial birth abortion ban case. Justice Ginsburg quoted Casey's sex equality reasoning in her Gonzales v. Carhart dissent. (51) But she went even further. Where Casev drew upon the conceptual framework of the sex equality argument for abortion rights--that government cannot use the power of the state to enforce traditional sex roles on women--Justice Ginsburg's Carhart dissent cited key equal protection sex discrimination precedents, including decisions she litigated and wrote, fusing the normative power of equality arguments with the textual authority of the Equal Protection Clause. (52)\n\nThe Court's liberal Justices have now begun to reason about abortion by appeal to the authority of the Equal Protection Clause; the question is whether Justice Kennedy might ever be moved to do so. James Bopp, Jr., (53) longtime lawyer for the National Right to Life Committee (and architect of Citizens United (54)), has urged anti-abortion advocates to challenge Roe incrementally and cautioned against pressing personhood amendments; in Bopp's view a constitutional challenge to a personhood amendment might provide the occasion for Justice Kennedy to endorse Justice Ginsburg's understanding of the abortion right. (55) In a strategy memo to the anti-abortion movement, Bopp warned:\n\nBut if the U.S. Supreme Court, as presently constituted, were to actually accept a case challenging the declared constitutional right to abortion, there is the potential danger that the Court might actually make things worse than they presently are. The majority might abandon its current \"substantive due process\" analysis (i.e., reading \"fundamental\" rights into the \"liberty\" guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment against infringement without due process) in favor of what Justice Ginsberg [sic] has long advocated--an \"equal protection\" analysis under the Fourteenth Amendment. In Gonzales v. Carhart, 127 S. Ct. 1610 (2007), the dissent, written by Justice Ginsberg [sic], in fact did so. See id. at 1641 (Ginsberg, [sic] J., joined by Stevens, Souter, and Breyer, JJ.) (\"[L]egal challenges to undue restrictions on abortion procedures do not seek to vindicate some generalized notion of privacy; rather, they center on a woman's autonomy to determine her life's course, and thus to enjoy equal citizenship stature.\") ... A law prohibiting abortion would force Justice Kennedy to vote to strike down the law, giving Justice Ginsberg [sic] the opportunity to rewrite the justification for the right to abortion for the Court. This is highly unlikely in a case that decides the  constitutionality of such things as PBA bans, parental involvement laws, women's right to-know laws, waiting periods, and other legislative acts that do not prohibit abortion in any way, since Justice Kennedy is likely to approve such laws. (56)\n\nLike Justice Ginsburg, James Bopp believes that an abortion right expressly and textually  anchored in the Equal Protection Clause would be much harder to disentrench.\n\nIV. Sex-Equality Perspectives on Reproductive Regulation Today\n\nOver the last several decades, the anti-stereotyping understanding of equality that informed Ginsburg's work as an advocate, academic, and judge has increasingly come to guide Supreme Court decisions about the regulation of reproduction* As we have seen, Casey drew on anti-stereotyping concepts to restate and reaffirm substantive due process doctrines that protect women's freedom to make decisions about whether to carry a pregnancy to term. (57) Even as contest narrows the abortion right; United States constitutional law remains distinctive in its concern to protect women's role-autonomy in making decisions about  motherhood. (58) And, after three decades of litigation under the Pregnancy Discrimination Amendment (PDA), the exclusion of pregnant women from employment is regularly analyzed on sex-equality and sex-stereotyping grounds. PDA case law has in turn begun to shape constitutional understandings of pregnancy in the workplace. (59)\n\nThat said, courts still cannot decide whether the restriction of contraceptive benefits raises a problem of sex discrimination under Title VII, and if so, why. The only sustained account of pregnancy-related discrimination as unconstitutional sex discrimination that the Court has provided appears in Nevada Department of Human Resources v. Hibbs  where the Court upheld Congress's power to enact the family-care provisions of the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) under Section Five of the Fourteenth Amendment. At the heart of Hibbs's holding that Congress had power to enact the FMLA's family leave provisions to remedy equal protection violations is the recognition that stereotyping of \"women when they are mothers and mothers-to-be\" plays a central role in discrimination against women at work.\n\nHibbs represents a crucial development in the Court's equal protection sex discrimination jurisprudence precisely because Hibbs recognizes pregnancy as a key locus of sex stereotyping directed against women who \"are mothers or mother-to-be\" (and does not simply treat pregnancy as a ground of \"real difference\" between the sexes). Hibbs opens the door to a new generation of equal protection cases arising out of stereotypes about, or animus against, women who \"are mothers or mothers-to-be.\" In the wake of Hibbs, the Court can read Geduldig more narrowly--and accurately--as allowing courts to find that under the Equal Protection Clause, certain acts of discrimination relating to pregnancy are discrimination on the basis of sex. Hibbs' understanding of discrimination--focused on young women who are or who are about to become mothers--was painstakingly forged through decades of litigation under the Pregnancy Discrimination Act and in conflicts over the Court's privacy and equal protection cases.\n\nBut Hibbs's understanding of the dynamics of sex stereotyping is conspicuously absent in the Court's recent ruling in Coleman v. Court of Appeals of Maryland that Congress lacked power under Section Five to enact the medical leave provisions of the Family Medical Leave Act--a decision from which Justice Ginsburg forcefully dissented. Justice Kennedy, writing for a plurality of the Court, voted to deny Section Five enforcement power for the medical leave provision, asserting that Congress had failed to document how providing sick-leave deterred or remedied sex discriminatory state action. In a lengthy account of the deliberations shaping design of the FMLA, Justice Ginsburg demonstrated that the genderneutral self-care and family-care provisions of the statute advanced Congress's goal of integrating work and family by means that would alleviate rather than exacerbate discrimination against women.\n\nAs Justice Ginsburg showed, Congress heard testimony that adding self-care leave to the statute would serve these ends in at least two ways. Requiring employers to provide employees self-care leave would provide female employees pregnancy-related leave, while \"ward[ing] off the unconstitutional discrimination [Congress] believed would attend a pregnancy-only leave requirement.\" Further, adding self-care leave would balance the Act's gender-neutral family leave provisions, which employers might view as protecting women's leave, with a form of leave employers would expect employees of both sexes to use, thereby diminishing the risk that the employers would view the new federal legislation as guaranteeing leave to women only. \"By reducing an employer's perceived incentive to avoid hiring women, [self-care leave] lessens the risk that the FMLA as a whole would give rise to the very sex discrimination that it was enacted to thwart.\" The Act's gender-neutral selfcare and family leave provisions worked together, Justice Ginsburg concluded:\n\nEssential to its design, Congress assiduously avoided a legislative package that, overall, was or would be seen as geared to women only. Congress thereby reduced employers' incentives to prefer men over women, advanced women's economic opportunities, and laid the foundation for more egalitarian relationship at home and at work. The self-care provision is a key part of that endeavor, and, in my view, a valid exercise of congressional power under [section] 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\nThe understanding of sex discrimination that Justice Ginsburg recognized in the design of the FMLA has animated her own work for decades. On this understanding, discrimination arises out of the interplay of real and imputed role conflicts. Employment is understood as inconsistent with pregnancy and caregiving responsibilities, and women are viewed as likely to become pregnant and engage in primary caregiving. Persisting role conflicts between caregiving and breadwinning and persisting sex-differentiated role expectations for men and women continuously interact to fuel sex stereotyping. Law can entrench the role conflicts and sex-differentiated role expectations that have long fueled sex stereotyping--or law can support individuals and households in making their own choices about the coordination of work and family.\n\nJustice Ginsburg made sense of the self-care provisions of the FMLA in light of these understandings. She understood the FMLA's self-care provisions as part of a set of leave protections that Congress enacted in an effort to support men and women in making their own choices about the coordination of work and family in a form that would disrupt rather than entrench sex-stereotypical conflicts and expectations--and so alleviate rather than exacerbate discrimination against women. Given her understanding of the dynamics of sex discrimination, Justice Ginsburg well appreciated why Congress made self-care leave available for all—rather than offering pregnancy leave to women only. Universal benefits break would down actual conflicts between work and family without triggering historic assumptions about sex roles. Targeted benefits, by contrast, might exacerbate employers' longstanding disposition to discriminate against young women in the workforce as unreliable or expensive hires because they are presumed to be \"mothers or mothers-to-be.\" Justice Ginsburg reasoned about the concerns, aspirations, and commitments animating the FMLA's design in terms the plurality seems not to have found sufficiently intelligible even to address.\n\n\n\nConclusion\n\nFrom time to time, courts and the general public view laws depriving women of control over contraception, abortion, and pregnancy as presenting questions of equal citizenship for women. Indeed we have recently witnessed conservative efforts to reassert traditional controls on women's reproductive lives colloquially termed a \"war on women.\" But today, as several decades ago, courts and the nation often do not grasp the relationships. Thirty-five years ago, Professor Ginsburg observed:\n\nEventually, the Court may take abortion, pregnancy, out-of-wedlock birth, and explicit gender-based differentials out of the separate cubbyholes in which they now rest, acknowledge the practical interrelationships, and treat these matters as part and parcel of a single, large, sex equality issue. That synthesis perhaps depends on clearer directions from the political arena, but it seems a likely candidate for 1980's development.\n\nIn 2012, we are still waiting."

        "context": "Legal case analysis\n\nThis article consists of two cases, please read carefully to understand the course of the case and the reasons for the court's decision.\n\n\n\nThe first case:Lucy v. Zehmer\n\nDetails of the case are as follows: This suit was instituted by W. O. Lucy and J. C. Lucy, complainants, against A. H. Zehmer and Ida S. Zehmer, his wife, defendants, to have specific performance of a contract by which it was alleged the Zehmers had sold to W. O. Lucy a tract of land owned by A. H. Zehmer in Dinwiddie county containing 471.6 acres, more or less, known as the Ferguson farm, for $50,000. J. C. Lucy, the other complainant, is a brother of W. O. Lucy, to whom W. O. Lucy transferred a half interest in his alleged purchase.\n\nThe instrument sought to be enforced was written by A. H. Zehmer on December 20, 1952, in these words: “We hereby agree to sell to W. O. Lucy the Ferguson Farm complete for $50,000.00, title satisfactory to buyer,” and signed by the defendants, A. H. Zehmer and Ida S. Zehmer.\n\nThe answer of A. H. Zehmer admitted that at the time mentioned W. O. Lucy offered him $50,000 cash for the farm, but that he, Zehmer, considered that the offer was made in jest; that so thinking, and both he and Lucy having had several drinks, he wrote out “the memorandum” quoted above and induced his wife to sign it; that he did not deliver the memorandum to Lucy, but that Lucy picked it up, read it, put it in his pocket, attempted to offer Zehmer $5 to bind the bargain, which Zehmer refused to accept, and realizing for the first time that Lucy was serious, Zehmer assured him that he had no intention of selling the farm and that the whole matter was a joke. Lucy left the premises insisting that he had purchased the farm.\n\nDepositions were taken and the decree appealed from was entered holding that the complainants had failed to establish their right to specific performance, and dismissing their bill. The assignment of error is to this action of the court.\n\nW. O. Lucy, a lumberman and farmer, thus testified in substance: He had known Zehmer for fifteen or twenty years and had been familiar with the Ferguson farm for ten years. Seven or eight years ago he had offered Zehmer $20,000 for the farm which Zehmer had accepted, but the agreement was verbal and Zehmer backed out. On the night of December 20, 1952, around eight o’clock, he took an employee to McKenney, where Zehmer lived and operated a restaurant, filling station and motor court. While there he decided to see Zehmer and again try to buy the Ferguson farm. He entered the restaurant and talked to Mrs. Zehmer until Zehmer came in. He asked Zehmer if he had sold the Ferguson farm. Zehmer replied that he had not.\n\nLucy said, “I bet you wouldn’t take $50,000.00 for that place.” Zehmer replied, “Yes, I would too; you wouldn’t give fifty.” Lucy said he would and told Zehmer to write up an agreement to that effect. Zehmer took a restaurant check and wrote on the back of it, “I do hereby agree to sell to W. O. Lucy the Ferguson Farm for $50,000 complete.” Lucy told him he had better change it to “We” because Mrs. Zehmer would have to sign it too. Zehmer then tore up what he had written, wrote the agreement quoted above and asked Mrs. Zehmer, who was at the other end of the counter ten or twelve feet away, to sign it. Mrs. Zehmer said she would for $50,000 and signed it. Zehmer brought it back and gave it to Lucy, who offered him $5 which Zehmer refused, saying, “You don’t need to give me any money, you got the agreement there signed by both of us.” [You can see a photo of the restaurant check at the end of the case.]\n\nThe discussion leading to the signing of the agreement, said Lucy, lasted thirty or forty minutes, during which Zehmer seemed to doubt that Lucy could raise $50,000. Lucy suggested the provision for having the title examined and Zehmer made the suggestion that he would sell it “complete, everything there,” and stated that all he had on the farm was three heifers.\n\nLucy took a partly filled bottle of whiskey into the restaurant with him for the purpose of giving Zehmer a drink if he wanted it. Zehmer did, and he and Lucy had one or two drinks together. Lucy said that while he felt the drinks he took he was not intoxicated, and from the way Zehmer handled the transaction he did not think he was either.\n\nDecember 20 was on Saturday. Next day Lucy telephoned to J. C. Lucy and arranged with the latter to take a half interest in the purchase and pay half of the consideration. On Monday he engaged an attorney to examine the title. The attorney reported favorably on December 31 and on January 2 Lucy wrote Zehmer stating that the title was satisfactory, that he was ready to pay the purchase price in cash and asking when Zehmer would be ready to close the deal. Zehmer replied by letter, mailed on January 13, asserting that he had never agreed or intended to sell.\n\nMr. and Mrs. Zehmer were called by the complainants as adverse witnesses. Zehmer testified in substance as follows:\n\nHe bought this farm more than ten years ago for $11,000. He had had twenty-five offers, more or less, to buy it, including several from Lucy, who had never offered any specific sum of money. He had given them all the same answer, that he was not interested in selling it. On this Saturday night before Christmas it looked like everybody and his brother came by there to have a drink. He took a good many drinks during the afternoon and had a pint of his own. When he entered the restaurant around eight-thirty Lucy was there and he could see that he was“pretty high.” He said to Lucy, “Boy, you got some good liquor, drinking, ain’t you?” Lucy then offered him a drink. “I was already high as a Georgia pine, and didn’t have any more better sense than to pour another great big slug out and gulp it down, and he took one too.”\n\nAfter they had talked a while Lucy asked whether he still had the Ferguson farm. He replied that he had not sold it and Lucy said, “I bet you wouldn’t take $50,000.00 for it.” Zehmer asked him if he would give $50,000 and Lucy said yes. Zehmer replied, “You haven’t got $50,000 in cash.” Lucy said he did and Zehmer replied that he did not believe it. They argued “pro and con for a long time,” mainly about “whether he had $50,000 in cash that he could put up right then and buy that farm.”\n\nFinally, said Zehmer, Lucy told him if he didn’t believe he had $50,000, “you sign that piece of paper here and say you will take $50,000.00 for the farm.” He, Zehmer, “just grabbed the back off of a guest check there” and wrote on the back of it. At that point in his testimony Zehmer asked to see what he had written to “see if I recognize my own handwriting.” He examined the paper and exclaimed, “Great balls of fire, I got ‘Firgerson’ for Ferguson. I have got satisfactory spelled wrong. I don’t recognize that writing if I would see it, wouldn’t know it was mine.”\n\nAfter Zehmer had, as he described it, “scribbled this thing off,” Lucy said, “Get your wife to sign it.” Zehmer walked over to where she was and she at first refused to sign but did so after he told her that he “was just needling him [Lucy], and didn’t mean a thing in the world, that I was not selling the farm.” Zehmer then “took it back over there… and I was still looking at the dern thing. I had the drink right there by my hand, and I reached over to get a drink, and he said, ‘Let me see it.’ He reached and picked it up, and when I looked back again he had it in his pocket and he dropped a five dollar bill over there, and he said, ‘Here is five dollars payment on it.’ …I said, ‘Hell no, that is beer and liquor talking. I am not going to sell you the farm. I have told you that too many times before.’”\n\nMrs. Zehmer testified that when Lucy came into the restaurant he looked as if he had had a drink. When Zehmer came in he took a drink out of a bottle that Lucy handed him. She went back to help the waitress who was getting things ready for next day. Lucy and Zehmer were talking but she did not pay too much attention to what they were saying. She heard Lucy ask Zehmer if he had sold the Ferguson farm, and Zehmer replied that he had not and did not want to sell it. Lucy said, “I bet you wouldn’t take $50,000 cash for that farm,” and Zehmer replied, “You haven’t got $50,000 cash.” Lucy said, “I can get it.” Zehmer said he might form a company and get it, “but you haven’t got $50,000.00 cash to pay me tonight.” Lucy asked him if he would put it in writing that he would sell him this farm. Zehmer then wrote on the back of a pad, “I agree to sell the Ferguson Place to W. O. Lucy for $50,000.00 cash.” Lucy said,“All right, get your wife to sign it.” Zehmer came back to where she was standing and said, “You want to put your name to this?” She said “No,” but he said in an undertone, “It is nothing but a joke,” and she signed it.\n\nShe said that only one paper was written and it said: “I hereby agree to sell,” but the “I” had been changed to “We”. However, she said she read what she signed and was then asked, “When you read ‘We hereby agree to sell to W. O. Lucy,’ what did you interpret that to mean, that particular phrase?” She said she thought that was a cash sale that night; but she also said that when she read that part about “title satisfactory to buyer” she understood that if the title was good Lucy would pay $50,000 but if the title was bad he would have a right to reject it, and that that was her understanding at the time she signed her name.\n\nOn examination by her own counsel she said that her husband laid this piece of paper down after it was signed; that Lucy said to let him see it, took it, folded it and put it in his wallet, then said to Zehmer,“Let me give you $5.00,”but Zehmer said, “No, this is liquor talking. I don’t want to sell the farm, I have told you that I want my son to have it. This is all a joke.” Lucy then said at least twice, “Zehmer, you have sold your farm,” wheeled around and started for the door. He paused at the door and said, “I will bring you $50,000.00 tomorrow. No, tomorrow is Sunday. I will bring it to you Monday.” She said you could tell definitely that he was drinking and she said to her husband, “You should have taken him home,” but he said, “Well, I am just about as bad off as he is.”\n\nThe waitress referred to by Mrs. Zehmer testified that when Lucy first came in “he was mouthy.” When Zehmer came in they were laughing and joking and she thought they took a drink or two. She was sweeping and cleaning up for next day. She said she heard Lucy tell Zehmer, “I will give you so much for the farm,” and Zehmer said, “You haven’t got that much.” Lucy answered, “Oh, yes, I will give you that much.” Then “they jotted down something on paper and Mr. Lucy reached over and took it, said let me see it.” He looked at it, put it in his pocket and in about a minute he left. She was asked whether she saw Lucy offer Zehmer any money and replied, “He had five dollars laying up there, they didn’t take it.” She said Zehmer told Lucy he didn’t want his money “because he didn’t have enough money to pay for his property, and wasn’t going to sell his farm.” Both of them appeared to be drinking right much, she said.\n\nShe repeated on cross-examination that she was busy and paying no attention to what was going on. She was some distance away and did not see either of them sign the paper. She was asked whether she saw Zehmer put the agreement down on the table in front of Lucy, and her answer was this: “Time he got through writing whatever it was on the paper, Mr. Lucy reached over and said, ‘Let’s see it.’ He took it and put it in his pocket,” before showing it to Mrs. Zehmer. Her version was that Lucy kept raising his offer until it got to $50,000.\n\nThe defendants insist that the evidence was ample to support their contention that the writing sought to be enforced was prepared as a bluff or dare to force Lucy to admit that he did not have $50,000; that the whole matter was a joke; that the writing was not delivered to Lucy and no binding contract was ever made between the parties.\n\nIt is an unusual, if not bizarre, defense. When made to the writing admittedly prepared by one of the defendants and signed by both, clear evidence is required to sustain it.\n\nIn his testimony Zehmer claimed that he “was high as a Georgia pine,” and that the transaction “was just a bunch of two doggoned drunks bluffing to see who could talk the biggest and say the most.” That claim is inconsistent with his attempt to testify in great detail as to what was said and what was done. It is contradicted by other evidence as to the condition of both parties, and rendered of no weight by the testimony of his wife that when Lucy left the restaurant she suggested that Zehmer drive him home. The record is convincing that Zehmer was not intoxicated to the extent of being unable to comprehend the nature and consequences of the instrument he executed, and hence that instrument is not to be invalidated on that ground. It was in fact conceded by defendants’ counsel in oral argument that under the evidence Zehmer was not too drunk to make a valid contract.\n\nThe evidence is convincing also that Zehmer wrote two agreements, the first one beginning “I hereby agree to sell.”Zehmer first said he could not remember about that, then that “I don’t think I wrote but one out.” Mrs. Zehmer said that what he wrote was “I hereby agree,” but that the “I” was changed to “We” after that night. The agreement that was written and signed is in the record and indicates no such change. Neither are the mistakes in spelling that Zehmer sought to point out readily apparent.\n\nThe appearance of the contract, the fact that it was under discussion for forty minutes or more before it was signed; Lucy’s objection to the first draft because it was written in the singular, and he wanted Mrs. Zehmer to sign it also; the rewriting to meet that objection and the signing by Mrs. Zehmer; the discussion of what was to be included in the sale, the provision for the examination of the title, the completeness of the instrument that was executed, the taking possession of it by Lucy with no request or suggestion by either of the defendants that he give it back, are facts which furnish persuasive evidence that the execution of the contract was a serious business transaction rather than a casual, jesting matter as defendants now contend.\n\nOn Sunday, the day after the instrument was signed on Saturday night, there was a social gathering in a home in the town of McKenney at which there were general comments that the sale had been made. Mrs. Zehmer testified that on that occasion as she passed by a group of people, including Lucy, who were talking about the transaction, $50,000 was mentioned, whereupon she stepped up and said, “Well, with the high-price whiskey you were drinking last night you should have paid more. That was cheap.” Lucy testified that at that time Zehmer told him that he did not want to “stick” him or hold him to the agreement because he, Lucy, was too tight and didn’t know what he was doing, to which Lucy replied that he was not too tight; that he had been stuck before and was going through with it. Zehmer’s version was that he said to Lucy: “I am not trying to claim it wasn’t a deal on account of the fact the price was too low. If I had wanted to sell $50,000.00 would be a good price, in fact I think you would get stuck at $50,000.00.” A disinterested witness testified that what Zehmer said to Lucy was that “he was going to let him up off the deal, because he thought he was too tight, didn’t know what he was doing. Lucy said something to the effect that ‘I have been stuck before and I will go through with it.’”\n\nIf it be assumed, contrary to what we think the evidence shows, that Zehmer was jesting about selling his farm to Lucy and that the transaction was intended by him to be a joke, nevertheless the evidence shows that Lucy did not so understand it but considered it to be a serious business transaction and the contract to be binding on the Zehmers as well as on himself. The very next day he arranged with his brother to put up half the money and take a half interest in the land. The day after that he employed an attorney to examine the title. The next night, Tuesday, he was back at Zehmer’s place and there Zehmer told him for the first time, Lucy said, that he wasn’t going to sell and he told Zehmer, “You know you sold that place fair and square.” After receiving the report from his attorney that the title was good he wrote to Zehmer that he was ready to close the deal.\n\nNot only did Lucy actually believe, but the evidence shows he was warranted in believing, that the contract represented a serious business transaction and a good faith sale and purchase of the farm.\n\nIn the field of contracts, as generally elsewhere, “We must look to the outward expression of a person as manifesting his intention rather than to his secret and unexpressed intention. ‘The law imputes to a person an intention corresponding to the reasonable meaning of his words and acts.’” At no time prior to the execution of the contract had Zehmer indicated to Lucy by word or act that he was not in earnest about selling the farm. They had argued about it and discussed its terms, as Zehmer admitted, for a long time. Lucy testified that if there was any jesting it was about paying $50,000 that night. The contract and the evidence show that he was not expected to pay the money that night. Zehmer said that after the writing was signed he laid it down on the counter in front of Lucy. Lucy said Zehmer handed it to him. In any event there had been what appeared to be a good faith offer and a good faith acceptance, followed by the execution and apparent delivery of a written contract. Both said that Lucy put the writing in his pocket  and then offered Zehmer $5 to seal the bargain. Not until then, even under the defendants’ evidence, was anything said or done to indicate that the matter was a joke. Both of the Zehmers testified that when Zehmer asked his wife to sign he whispered that it was a joke so Lucy wouldn’t hear and that it was not intended that he should hear.\n\nThe mental assent of the parties is not requisite for the formation of a contract. If the words or other acts of one of the parties have but one reasonable meaning, his undisclosed intention is immaterial except when an unreasonable meaning which he attaches to his manifestations is known to the other party. Restatement of the Law of Contracts, Vol. 1, 71, p. 74.\n\n“…The law, therefore, judges of an agreement between two persons exclusively from those expressions of their intentions which are communicated between them….” Clark on Contracts, 4 ed., 3, p. 4.\n\nAn agreement or mutual assent is of course essential to a valid contract but the law imputes to a person an intention corresponding to the reasonable meaning of his words and acts. If his words and acts, judged by a reasonable standard, manifest an intention to agree, it is immaterial what may be the real but unexpressed state of his mind.. So a person cannot set up that he was merely jesting when his conduct and words would warrant a reasonable person in believing that he intended a real agreement, 17 C. J. S., Contracts, 47, p. 390; Clark on Contracts, 4 ed., 27, at p. 54.\n\nWhether the writing signed by the defendants and now sought to be enforced by the complainants was the result of a serious offer by Lucy and a serious acceptance by the defendants, or was a serious offer by Lucy and an acceptance in secret jest by the defendants, in either event it constituted a binding contract of sale between the parties.\n\nDefendants contend further, however, that even though a contract was made, equity should decline to enforce it under the circumstances. These circumstances have been set forth in detail\n\nabove. They disclose some drinking by the two parties but not to an extent that they were unable to understand fully what they were doing. There was no fraud, no misrepresentation, no sharp practice and no dealing between unequal parties. The farm had been bought for $11,000 and was assessed for taxation at $6,300. The purchase price was $50,000. Zehmer admitted that it was a good price. There is in fact present in this case none of the grounds usually urged against specific performance.\n\nSpecific performance, it is true, is not a matter of absolute or arbitrary right, but is addressed to the reasonable and sound discretion of the court. But it is likewise true that the discretion which may be exercised is not an arbitrary or capricious one, but one which is controlled by the established doctrines and settled principles of equity; and, generally, where a contract is in its nature and circumstances unobjectionable, it is as much a matter of course for courts of equity to decree a specific performance of it as it is for a court of law to give damages for a breach of it. The complainants are entitled to have specific performance of the contracts sued on. The decree appealed from is therefore reversed and the cause is remanded for the entry of a proper decree requiring the defendants to perform the contract in accordance with the prayer of the bill. \n\n\n\n\n\nThe second case:Texaco, Inc. v. Pennzoil, Co.\n\nDetails of the case are as follows:\n\nThis is an appeal from a judgment awarding Pennzoil damages for Texaco’s tortious interference with a contract between Pennzoil and the “Getty entities” (Getty Oil Company, the Sarah C. Getty Trust, and the J. Paul Getty Museum).\n\nThe jury found, among other things, that:\n\n(1)At the end of a board meeting on January 3, 1984, the Getty entities intended to bind themselves to an agreement providing for the purchase of Getty Oil stock, whereby the Sarah C. Getty Trust would own 4/7th of the stock and Pennzoil the remaining 3/7th; and providing for a division of Getty Oil’s assets, according to their respective ownership if the Trust and Pennzoil were unable to agree on a restructuring of Getty Oil by December 31, 1984;\n\n(2)Texaco knowingly interfered with the agreement between Pennzoil and the Getty entities;\n\n(3)As a result of Texaco’s interference, Pennzoil suffered damages of $7.53 billion; Texaco’s actions were intentional, willful, and in wanton disregard of Pennzoil’s rights; and,\n\n(4)Pennzoil was entitled to punitive damages of $3 billion.\n\nThe main questions for our determination are: (1) whether the evidence supports the jury’s finding that there was a binding contract between the Getty entities and Pennzoil, and that Texaco knowingly induced a breach of such contract; (2) whether the trial court properly instructed the jury on the law pertinent to the case; * * *.\n\nThough many facts are disputed, the parties’ main conflicts are over the inferences to be drawn from, and the legal significance of, these facts. There is evidence that for several months in late 1983, Pennzoil had followed with interest the well-publicized dissension between the board of directors of Getty Oil Company and Gordon Getty, who was a director of Getty Oil and also the owner, as trustee, of approximately 40.2% of the outstanding shares of Getty Oil. On December 28, 1983, Pennzoil announced an unsolicited, public tender offer for 16 million shares of Getty Oil at $100 each.\n\nSoon afterwards, Pennzoil contacted both Gordon Getty and a representative of the J. Paul Getty Museum, which held approximately 11.8% of the shares of Getty Oil, to discuss the tender offer and the possible purchase of Getty Oil. In the first two days of January 1984, a “Memorandum of Agreement” was drafted to reflect the terms that had been reached in conversations between representatives of Pennzoil, Gordon Getty, and the Museum.\n\nUnder the plan set out in the Memorandum of Agreement, Pennzoil and the Trust (with Gordon Getty as trustee) were to become partners on a 3/7ths to 4/7ths basis respectively, in owning and operating Getty Oil. Gordon Getty was to become chairman of the board, and Hugh Liedtke, the chief executive officer of Pennzoil, was to become chief executive officer of the new company.\n\nThe Memorandum of Agreement further provided that the Museum was to receive $110 per share for its 11.8% ownership, and that all other outstanding public shares were to be cashed in by the company at $110 per share. Pennzoil was given an option to buy an additional 8 million shares to achieve the desired ownership ratio. The plan also provided that Pennzoil and the Trust were to try in good faith to agree upon a plan to restructure Getty Oil within a year, but if they could not reach an agreement, the assets of Getty Oil were to be divided between them, 3/7ths to Pennzoil and 4/7ths to the Trust.\n\nThe Memorandum of Agreement stated that it was subject to approval of the board of Getty Oil, and it was to expire by its own terms if not approved at the board meeting that was to begin on January 2. Pennzoil’s CEO, Liedtke, and Gordon Getty, for the Trust, signed the Memorandum of Agreement before the Getty Oil board meeting on January 2, and Harold Williams, the president of the Museum, signed it shortly after the board meeting began. Thus, before it was submitted to the Getty Oil board, the Memorandum of Agreement had been executed by parties who together controlled a majority of the outstanding shares of Getty Oil. The Memorandum of Agreement was then presented to the Getty Oil board, which had previously held discussions on how the company should respond to Pennzoil’s public tender offer. A self-tender by the company to shareholders at $110 per share had been proposed to defeat Pennzoil’s tender offer at $100 per share, but no consensus was reached.\n\nThe board voted to reject recommending Pennzoil’s tender offer to Getty’s shareholders, then later also rejected the Memorandum of Agreement price of $110 per share as too low. Before recessing at 3 a.m., the board decided to make a counterproposal to Pennzoil of $110 per share plus a $10 debenture. Pennzoil’s investment banker reacted to this price negatively. In the morning of January 3, Getty Oil’s investment banker, Geoffrey Boisi, began calling other companies, seeking a higher bid than Pennzoil’s for the Getty Oil shares.\n\nWhen the board reconvened at 3 p.m. on January 3, a revised Pennzoil proposal was presented, offering $110 per share plus a $3 “stub” that was to be paid after the sale of a Getty Oil subsidiary (“ERC”), from the excess proceeds over $1 billion. Each shareholder was to receive a pro rata share of these excess proceeds, but in any case, a minimum of $3 per share at the end of five years. During the meeting, Boisi briefly informed the board of the status of his inquiries of other companies that might be interested in bidding for the company. He reported some preliminary indications of interest, but no definite bid yet.\n\nThe Museum’s lawyer told the board that, based on his discussions with Pennzoil, he believed that if the board went back “firm” with an offer of $110 plus a $5 stub, Pennzoil would accept it. After a recess, the Museum’s president (also a director of Getty Oil) moved that the Getty board should accept Pennzoil’s proposal provided that the stub be raised to $5, and the board voted 15 to 1 to approve this counter-proposal to Pennzoil. The board then voted themselves and Getty’s officers and advisors indemnity for any liability arising from the events of the past few months. Additionally, the board authorized its executive compensation committee to give “golden parachutes” (generous termination benefits) to the top executives whose positions “were likely to be affected” by the change in management. There was evidence that during another brief recess of the board meeting, the counter-offer of $110 plus a $5 stub was presented to and accepted by Pennzoil. After Pennzoil’s acceptance was conveyed to the Getty board, the meeting was adjourned, and most board members left town for their respective homes.\n\nThat evening, the lawyers and public relations staff of Getty Oil and the Museum drafted a press release describing the transaction between Pennzoil and the Getty entities. The press release, announcing an agreement in principle on the terms of the Memorandum of Agreement but with a price of $110 plus a $5 stub, was issued on Getty Oil letterhead the next morning, January 4, and later that day, Pennzoil issued an identical press release.\n\nOn January 4, Boisi continued to contact other companies, looking for a higher price than Pennzoil had offered. After talking briefly with Boisi, Texaco management called several meetings with its in-house financial planning group, which over the course of the day studied and reported to management on the value of Getty Oil, the Pennzoil offer terms, and a feasible price range at which Getty might be acquired. Later in the day, Texaco hired an investment banker, First Boston, to represent it with respect to a possible acquisition of Getty Oil. Meanwhile, also on January 4, Pennzoil’s lawyers were working on a draft of a formal “transaction agreement” that described the transaction in more detail than the outline of terms contained in the Memorandum of Agreement and press release.\n\nOn January 5, the Wall Street Journal reported on an agreement reached between Pennzoil and the Getty entities, describing essentially the terms contained in the Memorandum of Agreement. The Pennzoil board met to ratify the actions of its officers in negotiating an agreement with the Getty entities, and Pennzoil’s attorneys periodically attempted to contact the other parties’ advisors and attorneys to continue work on the transaction agreement.\n\nThe board of Texaco also met on January 5, authorizing its officers to make an offer for 100% of Getty Oil and to take any necessary action in connection therewith. Texaco first contacted the Museum’s lawyer, Lipton, and arranged a meeting to discuss the sale of the Museum’s shares of Getty Oil to Texaco. Lipton instructed his associate, on her way to the meeting in progress of the lawyers drafting merger documents for the Pennzoil/Getty transaction, to not attend that meeting, because he needed her at his meeting with Texaco. At the meeting with Texaco, the Museum outlined various issues it wanted resolved in any transaction with Texaco, and then agreed to sell its 11.8% ownership in Getty Oil.\n\nThat evening, Texaco met with Gordon Getty to discuss the sale of the Trust’s shares. He was informed that the Museum had agreed to sell its shares to Texaco. Gordon Getty’s advisors had previously warned him that the Trust shares might be “locked out” in a minority position if Texaco bought, in addition to the Museum’s shares, enough of the public shares to achieve over 50% ownership of the company. Gordon Getty accepted Texaco’s offer of $125 per share and signed a letter of his intent to sell his stock to Texaco, as soon as a California temporary restraining order against his actions as trustee was lifted.\n\nAt noon on January 6, Getty Oil held a telephone board meeting to discuss the Texaco offer. The board voted to withdraw its previous counter-proposal to Pennzoil and unanimously voted to accept Texaco’s offer. Texaco immediately issued a press release announcing that Getty Oil and Texaco would merge.\n\nSoon after the Texaco press release appeared, Pennzoil telexed the Getty entities, demanding that they honor their agreement with Pennzoil. Later that day, prompted by the telex, Getty Oil filed a suit in Delaware for declaratory judgment that it was not bound to any contract with Pennzoil. The merger agreement between Texaco and Getty Oil was signed on January 6; the stock purchase agreement with the Museum was signed on January 6; and the stock exchange agreement with the Trust was signed on January 8, 1984. * * *\n\nSPECIAL ISSUE NO. 1\n\nTexaco contends that under controlling principles of New York law, there was insufficient evidence to support the jury’s finding that at the end of the Getty Oil board meeting on January 3, the Getty entities intended to bind themselves to an agreement with Pennzoil.\n\nPennzoil responds that the question of the parties’ intent is a fact question, and the jury was free to accept or reject Texaco’s after-the-fact testimony of subjective intent. Pennzoil contends that the evidence showed that the parties intended to be bound to the terms in the Memorandum of Agreement plus a price terms of $110 plus a $5 stub, even though the parties may have contemplated a later, more formal document to memorialize the agreement already reached. * * *\n\nUnder New York law, if parties do not intend to be bound to an agreement until it is reduced to writing and signed by both parties, then there is no contract until that event occurs. If there is no understanding that a signed writing is necessary before the parties will be bound, and the parties have agreed upon all substantial terms, then an informal agreement can be binding, even though the parties contemplate evidencing their agreement in a formal document later. If the parties do intend to contract orally, the mere intention to commit the agreement to writing does not prevent contract formation before execution of that writing, and even a failure to reduce their promises to writing is immaterial to whether they are bound. However, if either party communicates the intent not to be bound before a final formal document is executed, then no oral expression of agreement to specific terms will constitute a binding contract. Thus, under New York law, the parties are given the power to obligate themselves informally or only by a formal signed writing, as they wish. The emphasis in deciding when a binding contract exists is on intent rather than on form. \n\nIt is the parties’ expressed intent that controls which rule of contract formation applies. To determine intent, a court must examine the words and deeds of the parties, because these constitute the objective signs of such intent. Only the outward expressions of intent are considered—secret or subjective intent is immaterial to the question of whether the parties were bound. \n\nSeveral factors have been articulated to help determine whether the parties intended to be bound only by a formal, signed writing: (1) whether a party expressly reserved the right to be bound only when a written agreement is signed; (2) whether there was any partial performance by one party that the party disclaiming the contract accepted; (3) whether all essential terms of the alleged contract had been agreed upon; and (4) whether the complexity or magnitude of the transaction was such that a formal, executed writing would normally be expected. \n\nEvaluating the first factor, Texaco contends that the evidence of expressed intent not to be bound establishes conclusively that there was no contract at the time of Texaco’s alleged inducement of breach. Texaco argues that this expressed intent is contained in (1) the press releases issued by the Getty entities and Pennzoil, which stated that “the transaction is subject to execution of a definitive merger agreement”; (2) the phrasing of drafts of the transaction agreement, which Texaco alleges “carefully stated that the parties’ obligations would become binding only ‘after the execution and delivery of this Agreement’”; and (3) the deliberate reference by the press releases to the parties’ understanding as an “agreement in principle.”\n\nIn its brief, Texaco asserts that, as a matter of black letter New York law, the “subject to” language in the press release established that the parties were not then bound and intended to be bound only after signing a definitive agreement. The court in that case stated that “if the agreement is expressly subject to the execution of a formal contract, this intent must be respected and no contract found until then.” However, the court went on to say that where intent is less sharply expressed, the trier of fact must determine it as best he can. Id. at 204-05. Although the intent to formalize an agreement is some evidence of an intent not to be bound before signing such a writing, it is not conclusive. Id. at 204. The issue of when the parties intended to be bound is a fact question to be decided from the parties’ acts and communications. Id.\n\nThe press release issued first by Getty, then by Pennzoil, on January 4, 1984, stated:\n\nGetty Oil Company, The J. Paul Getty Museum and Gordon Getty, as Trustee of the Sarah C. Getty Trust, announced today that they have agreed in principle with Pennzoil Company to a merger of Getty Oil and a newly formed entity owned by Pennzoil and the Trustee.\n\nIn connection with the transaction, the shareholders of Getty Oil ... will receive $110 per share cash plus the right to receive a deferred cash consideration in a formula amount. The deferred consideration will be equal to a pro rata share of the ... proceeds, in excess of $1 billion, ... of ERC Corporation, ... and will be paid upon the disposition. In any event, under the formula, each shareholder will receive at least $5 per share within five years.\n\nPrior to the merger, Pennzoil will contribute approximately $2.6 billion in cash and the Trustee and Pennzoil will contribute the Getty Oil shares owned by them to the new entity. Upon execution of a definitive merger agreement, the ... tender offer by a Pennzoil subsidiary for shares of Getty Oil stock will be withdrawn.\n\nThe agreement in principle also provides that Getty Oil will grant to Pennzoil an option to purchase eight million treasury shares for $110 per share.\n\nThe transaction is subject to execution of a definitive merger agreement, approval by the stockholders of Getty Oil and completion of various governmental filing and waiting period requirements.\n\nFollowing consummation of the merger, the Trust will own 4/7ths of the ... stock of Getty Oil and Pennzoil will own 3/7ths. The Trust and Pennzoil have also agreed in principle that following consummation of the merger they will endeavor in good faith to agree upon a plan for restructuring Getty Oil [within a year] and that if they are unable to reach such an agreement then they will cause a division of assets of the company. (Emphasis added.)\n\nAny intent of the parties not to be bound before signing a formal document is not so clearly expressed in the press release to establish, as a matter of law, that there was no contract at that time. The press release does refer to an agreement “in principle” and states that the “transaction” is subject to execution of a definitive merger agreement. But the release as a whole is worded in indicative terms, not in subjunctive or hypothetical ones. The press release describes what shareholders will receive, what Pennzoil will contribute, that Pennzoil will be granted an option, etc.\n\nThe description of the transaction as subject to a definitive merger agreement also includes the need for stockholder approval and the completion of various governmental filing and waiting requirements. There was evidence that this was a paragraph of routine details, that the referred to merger agreement was a standard formal document required in such a transaction under Delaware law, and that the parties considered these technical requirements of little consequence.\n\nThere is also an arguable difference between a “transaction” being subject to various requirements and the formation of the agreement itself being dependent upon completion of these matters. In F. W. Berk & Co. v. Derecktor, 301 N.Y. 110, 92 N.E.2d 914 (1950), cited in Texaco’s brief, the defendant’s very acceptance of the plaintiff’s order was made subject to the occurrence of certain events. The court defined the phrase “subject to” as being the equivalent\n\nof “conditional upon or depending on” and held that making the acceptance of an offer subject to a condition was not the kind of assent required to make it a binding promise. However, making the acceptance of an offer conditional, or expressly making an agreement itself conditional, is a much clearer expression of an intent not to be bound than the use of the more ambiguous word “transaction.”\n\nOther cases cited by Texaco involved writings that specifically stated that no party would be committed until a written contract was executed. See, e.g., Reprosystem, B. V., 727 F.2d at 260 (draft agreements clearly stated that formal execution was required before the contract would have any binding effect); Chromalloy American Corp., 495 F.Supp. at 547-48 (letter of intent stated that neither party would be committed until a contract was executed). Yet, despite the clear language of reservation in those cases, the parties’ intent to be bound was still evaluated as a question of fact to be determined from all the circumstances of the case. So it is here. Regardless of what interpretation we give to the conditional language in the press release, we conclude that it did not so clearly express the intent of the parties not to be bound to conclusively resolve that issue, as Texaco asserts.\n\nTexaco also contends that explicit language of reservation in drafts of Pennzoil’s transaction agreement indicates the parties’ expressed intent not to be bound without a signed writing. Texaco asserts that “Pennzoil’s lawyers carefully stated that the parties’ obligations would become binding only ‘after the execution and delivery of this Agreement.’” That assertion is not accurate. In fact, “after the execution and delivery of this Agreement” was merely used as an introductory phrase before each party’s obligations were described, e.g., after the execution and delivery of this Agreement, Pennzoil shall terminate the tender offer; ... Pennzoil and the Company shall terminate all legal proceedings; ... the Company shall purchase all shares held by the Museum; etc. Other clauses in the transaction agreement did not contain that phrase, e.g., the Company hereby grants to Pennzoil the option to purchase up to 8 million shares of treasury stock; on or prior to the effective date, Pennzoil and the Trustee shall form the merging company; etc. A reasonable conclusion from reading the entire drafts is that the phrase “after the execution and delivery of this Agreement” was used chiefly to indicate the timing of various acts that were to occur, and not to impose an express precondition to the formation of a contract. * * *\n\nNext, Texaco states that the use of the term “agreement in principle” in the press release was a conscious and deliberate choice of words to convey that there was not yet any binding agreement. Texaco refers to defense testimony that lawyers for Getty Oil and the Museum changed the initial wording of the press release from “agreement” to “agreement in principle” because they understood and intended that phrase to mean that there was no binding contract with Pennzoil. … Pennzoil and Texaco presented conflicting evidence at trial on the common business usage and understanding of the term “agreement in principle.” … There was sufficient evidence at trial on the common business usage of the expression “agreement in principle” and on its meaning in this case for the jury reasonably to decide that its use in the press release did not necessarily establish that the parties did not intend to be bound before signing a formal document.\n\nA second factor that may indicate whether the parties intended to be bound only by a signed, formal writing is whether there was partial performance by one party that the party disclaiming the contract accepted. Texaco asserts that there was no partial performance that would indicate an intent to be bound, but conversely, that the conduct of the parties here was inconsistent with the existence of a binding contract. … Other than the preliminary financial arrangements made by Pennzoil, we find little relevant partial performance in this case that might show that the parties believed that they were bound by a contract. However, the absence of relevant part performance in this short period of time does not compel the conclusion that no contract existed. Texaco has pointed out that there was some conduct inconsistent with the existence of an intent to be bound to a contract. But partial performance, and on the other hand, conduct that is inconsistent with an intent to be bound, are again merely circumstances that the finder of fact could consider in reaching a decision on whether the parties intended to be bound. The evidence on the parties’ conduct was presented to the jury, which could either accept or reject the inferences the parties asked it to draw from these facts.\n\nThe next factor showing intent to be bound is whether there was agreement on all essential terms of the alleged agreement. Texaco contends that numerous items of “obvious importance” were still being negotiated at the time Pennzoil claims a contract had been formed. First, Texaco asserts that there was no agreement on which party would buy the Museum’s stock. Pennzoil contends that its contract was formed on January 3, and that intent to be bound must be determined as of that date. The jury specifically found, in response to Special Issue No. 6, that at the end of the January 3 board meeting, the Getty Oil Company, the Museum, the Trust, and Pennzoil each intended to be bound to an agreement that provided that Getty Oil would purchase the Museum’s shares forthwith as provided in the Memorandum of Agreement. There is evidence in the record to support this finding. …\n\nThere was sufficient evidence for the jury to conclude that the parties had reached agreement on all essential terms of the transaction with only the mechanics and details left to be supplied by the parties’ attorneys. Although there may have been many specific items relating to the transaction agreement draft that had yet to be put in final form, there is sufficient evidence to support a conclusion by the jury that the parties did not consider any of Texaco’s asserted “open items” significant obstacles precluding an intent to be bound.\n\nThe fourth factor that Texaco discusses as showing that the parties did not intend to be bound before executing a formal contract is the magnitude and complexity of the transaction. There is little question that the transaction by which Getty Oil was to be taken private by the Trust and Pennzoil involved an extremely large amount of money. It is unlikely that parties to such a transaction would not have expected a detailed written document, specifically setting out the parties’ obligations and the exact mechanics of the transaction, whether it was to be executed before the parties intended to be bound or only to memorialize an agreement already reached.\n\nWe agree with Texaco that this factor tends to support its position that the transaction was such that a signed contract would ordinarily be expected before the parties would consider themselves bound. However, we cannot say, as a matter of law, that this factor alone is determinative of the question of the parties’ intent.\n\nThe trial of this case lasted many weeks, with witnesses for both sides testifying extensively about the events of those first days of January 1984. Eyewitnesses and expert witnesses interpreted and explained various aspects of the negotiations and the alleged agreement, and the jury was repeatedly made aware of the value of Getty Oil’s assets and how much money would be involved in the company’s sale. There was testimony on how the sale of the company could be structured and on the considerations involved in buying and restructuring, or later liquidating, the company. But there was also testimony that there were companies that in the past had bound themselves to short two-page acquisition agreements involving a lot of money, and Getty’s involvement banker testified that the Texaco transaction included “one page back-of-the-envelope kinds of agreements” that were formalized. The Memorandum of Agreement containing the essential terms of the Pennzoil/Getty agreement was only four pages long.\n\nAlthough the magnitude of the transaction here was such that normally a signed writing would be expected, there was sufficient evidence to support an inference by the jury that that expectation was satisfied here initially by the Memorandum of Agreement, signed by a majority of shareholders of Getty Oil and approved by the board with a higher price, and by the transaction agreement in progress that had been intended to memorialize the agreement previously reached. * * *\n\n[The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court on condition that Pennzoil file a remittitur agreeing of the reduction of punitive damages from $3 billion to $1 billion. The judgment for $7.53 billon in compensatory damages was unaffected by the remittitur.]"

        "context": "Chronic Absenteeism and Disrupted Learning Require an All-Hands-on-Deck Approach\n\nK-12 absenteeism has increased since the onset of COVID-19 and has contributed to falling test scores. Improving engagement is key for student success and the broader economy.\n\n\n\nPolicies promoting strong schools and academic success impact students’ lives as adults, long after they leave the classroom. Beyond the significance for individuals, the educational development of our children and young people is a key input into the economy and has spillover benefits to society more broadly.  While the evidence is clear that students and society benefit from attending well-resourced schools with effective teachers, these benefits can only materialize if students are present and engaged. \n\nA necessary step to ensure students benefit from all that schools have to offer is to support students’ consistent presence in the classroom—which is why the Biden-Harris Administration is focused on the issue of chronic absenteeism. In the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic, one study found that the number of public school students who are chronically absent—meaning they miss at least 10 percent of days in a school year, whether excused or unexcused—has nearly doubled, from about 15 percent in the 2018-2019 school year to around 30 percent in 2021-2022.[1] These large increases in absenteeism are widespread: every state for which data were available in this study saw significant increases in rates of chronic absenteeism between the 2018-2019 and 2021-2022 school years. Disparities in levels of chronic absenteeism across racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic lines also widened.\n\nResearch shows that school absences take a toll on grades and performance on standardized tests. Beyond test scores, irregular attendance can be a predictor of high school drop-out, which has been linked to poor labor market prospects, diminished health, and increased involvement in the criminal justice system. Students who are chronically absent are at higher risk for these adverse outcomes.\n\nThe increases in chronic absenteeism are large enough that they could be a substantial contributor to declines in post-pandemic test scores. (While test scores are not the only important aspect of student success, they provide a measurable early indicator that is predictive of broader long-term outcomes.)  To examine this question, the Council of Economic Advisers partnered with the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) to analyze national data which includes measures of both standardized test scores and absenteeism during the 2018-2019 and 2021-2022 school years.[2] Using regression analysis to document the strong association between absenteeism and test scores (after controlling for other factors), we then implement a decomposition analysis to simulate how much of the decline in test scores could be attributed to increases in absenteeism.[3]\n\nFigure 1 illustrates the results of this descriptive analysis. The vertical bars indicate the average decline in scores between 2019 and 2022, by subject and grade level. The green portions of each bar indicate how much smaller these declines might be if absenteeism had not increased at all. We find that, even after controlling for changes in other characteristics of the student body over time, the observed association between absenteeism and test scores is large enough to account for 16-27 percent of the overall test score declines in math, and 36-45 percent of the declines in reading.\n\nThese results come with several caveats: most importantly, we do not yet know the extent to which the recent increase in absenteeism is a stand-alone, causal contributor to test score declines, and to what extent it is a symptom of other factors that could account for both the increases in student absenteeism and declines in performance. Such factors could include declining mental and physical health, familial responsibilities, or other demands on students’ mental and physical resources.\n\n\n\nGiven the magnitude of test score declines and extent of chronic absenteeism, pandemic recovery efforts require an “all-hands-on-deck” response.  While State-administered test scores from the 2021-2022 and 2022-2023 school years show some early signs of rebounding from the major disruptions of the pandemic, estimates suggest the average elementary school student would need sufficient supports and instructional time to sustain additional gains for several years in order to reach the performance of comparable pre-COVID cohorts. Without such sustained investments, one group of researchers estimated that these disruptions could cost American students $2 trillion in lifetime earnings.\n\nEnsuring that all students benefit from the full scope of pandemic recovery efforts requires that they are present in schools. Targeted interventions such as early warning systems, mailing outreach, and text nudges have shown promise in increasing attendance, especially among students who would have otherwise have been chronically absent from school. Research on the potential benefits of high-dosage tutoring and other evidence-based interventions implemented in afterschool programs or summer school can help educators and school leaders create a network of supports that best address student needs.\n\nThe Biden-Harris Administration has undertaken significant efforts to combat chronic absenteeism and make sure that students are in the classroom and engaged in school. This includes: disseminating grant funds that can resource interventions and supports; offering technical assistance to States and districts; investing in comprehensive mental health programs for students; and establishing and strengthening the National Partnership for Student Success, which marshals evidence-backed supports such as tutoring and mentoring to help keep students engaged and on-track. Additionally, States have until next school year to use remaining Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief funds set aside for P-12 schools in the American Rescue Plan that can be used towards academic recovery, school attendance and engagement, and other efforts.\n\nMaking up for lost time and learning disruption means empowering students and their families to take an active role in their academic recovery, and tracking and addressing chronic absenteeism will be an important aspect of these recovery efforts in the months and years to come. Ultimately, whether chronic absenteeism is a symptom or a cause—or both—of ongoing academic disruption, the evidence is clear that the road to recovery runs through the classroom.\n\n\n\n[1] These chronic absenteeism rates come from an academic study that collected administrative data from 40 states (and the District of Columbia), accounting for over 92 percent of K-12 public school students in the United States.\n\n[2] We analyze student level test scores from the National Assessment of Student Progress (NAEP) in this analysis. NAEP, also known as the “Nation’s Report Card,” is the largest nationally representative and continuing assessment of student learning. The absenteeism measure in NAEP is self-reported by students and reflects days missed over the past month. While the levels of absenteeism are measured differently than in administrative records, the increases over time are similarly large.\n\n[3] The analysis is a type of non-causal, Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition which takes account of 1) the magnitude of changes in absenteeism over time and 2) the observed association between absenteeism and test scores (after controlling for other factors), to compute how much of the test score decline could potentially be explained by changes in absenteeism. The regressions include controls for race/ethnicity, gender, English language proficiency, free and reduced-price lunch status, number of books at home, and disability status. To the extent that absenteeism is also correlated with these controls, the analysis may understate the explanatory role of absenteeism.\n\n\n\n\n\nFACT SHEET: Update on the United States Commitment to Expanding Access to Medicines Around the World\n\nSince Day One, the Biden-Harris Administration has worked to ensure the United States is better prepared for the next pandemic. U.S. national security and prosperity depend on countries around the world being prepared to prevent outbreaks when possible, and to rapidly detect and respond to emerging infectious disease threats when they occur. Detecting infectious disease threats quickly, and sharing that information widely, is critical to limit global transmission, and to rapidly develop necessary diagnostics, vaccines, treatments, personal protective equipment, and other countermeasures. Once available, facilitating equitable domestic and global access to medical countermeasures, like vaccines, tests and treatments, is the best way to minimize global morbidity and mortality, as well as to reduce economic and other disruptions. Collectively, these actions will make the United States, and the world, safer from the risk posed by pandemics and other biological events.\n\nCoupled with broader investments in health, the United States is supporting countries around the world to expand access to quality medical countermeasures (MCMs), including vaccines, tests, and treatments, to end long-standing threats such as HIV, growing threats such as measles, and novel threats like COVID-19. These investments built on decades of global health and health security leadership by the United States. In the first three years of the Biden-Harris Administration, the United States invested nearly $32 billion globally to: better prepare for the next pandemic; fight existing epidemics like HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis (TB), and malaria; and ensure high-need communities have access to essential health services like routine childhood immunization and maternal and child healthcare. Starting in 2021, the United States also invested $16 billion in the global COVID-19 response, including sharing nearly 700 million COVID-19 vaccine doses with countries around the world. The President’s FY 2025 Budget includes nearly $10 billion to continue these investments in critical global health programs, strengthen health systems, and enhance pandemic preparedness.\n\nThe Biden-Harris Administration remains committed to expanding access to MCMs around the world, including through investments in innovation, research and development; building sustainable global manufacturing and supply chain capacity; providing vaccines, tests and treatments and support for their delivery; expanding pandemic response financing for MCMs; and strengthening legal and regulatory systems. Examples include:\n\nInvesting in Innovation, Research and Development\n\nThe U.S. government invested billions of dollars in mRNA technology in advance of the COVID-19 pandemic. These public investments translated into millions of lives saved in the United States and around the world, and were crucial to developing the mRNA vaccine technology that can be leveraged in a future pandemic, as well as potentially treating other diseases.\n\nThe Biden-Harris Administration’s historic investments in science and technology, from basic science to piloting innovative financing mechanisms to real-time research during health emergencies, are transforming the tools and approaches we use to detect, contain and respond to health threats. This work is often done in partnership with biopharmaceutical innovators and manufacturers that have unique roles to play in global health security. Examples include:\n\nPublic-private partnership on the Ebola virus. Public-private partnerships through the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), resulted in a licensed Ebola vaccine, two licensed monoclonal antibody treatments, and one cleared diagnostic for Ebola; technologies that are now being applied to other viruses such as Marburg.\n\nSupport for the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), which is working to accelerate the development of life-saving vaccines against emerging disease threats, and to transform capability for rapid countermeasure development in response to future threats. Notable achievements include: the market authorization of the world’s first Chikungunya vaccine; the advancement through clinical development of vaccine candidates against Lassa, Nipah, and coronaviruses, among others; and the launch of a new Disease X Vaccine Library with six viral families prioritized as high risk.\n\nInnovation in TB and HIV prevention and treatment. Pretomanid, a treatment for drug-resistant TB, developed with support from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), has reduced TB treatment time from up to 18 months to 6 months and dramatically improved outcomes. New long-acting HIV/AIDS prevention options such as cabotegravir, a single bi-monthly injection, could avert many new future HIV infections in low- and middle-income countries. The dapivirine vaginal ring, a long-acting HIV prevention tool, is a breakthrough innovation that offers women another method of discreet protection.\n\nNew products to address drug-resistant infections. BARDA is investing over $2 billion in new products to address drug-resistant infections that have resulted in 10 therapeutics and diagnostics receiving Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval or clearance and revitalizing late-stage antimicrobial product development across dozens of products for both adults and children.\n\nBuilding Sustainable Global Manufacturing and Supply Chain Capacity\n\nThe United States is investing in sustainable and resilient global medical manufacturing and supply chain capacity. Robust systems for production and delivery of MCMs not only helps improve health – ensuring more people are able to routinely receive life-saving vaccines and therapeutics like antiretrovirals (ARVs) – they also serve as an essential foundation for effective emergency response. Sustainable systems must provide the infrastructure, resilience, quality assurance, operational efficiency, steady demand, and public confidence necessary to respond promptly and effectively to emergencies while ensuring the continuity of essential healthcare services. Examples of United States investments in sustainable manufacturing systems include:\n\nU.S. Development Finance Corporation (DFC) finances and catalyzes investments by the private sector and other development finance institutions in health commodity manufacturing and supply chain for MCMs in developing countries, with a focus on Africa. DFC, along with International Finance Corporation and other like-minded development finance institutions (DFIs), is supporting the Institut Pasteur de Dakar in Senegal to become a key hub in the African Union’s vaccine production network. DFC previously provided a $3.3 million technical assistance grant for early-stage project development and is evaluating additional financing for expansion of the industrial-scale facility. DFC is also working with peer DFIs to provide working capital to regional manufacturers to enable producers to pivot and scale up efforts during a health emergency.\n\nAccelerating the expansion of vaccine manufacturing in Africa. The United States is supporting Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance (Gavi), working in collaboration with the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC), to establish the African Vaccine Manufacturing Accelerator, a $1 billion advanced market commitment financial instrument that would provide financial support over the next ten years to accelerate the expansion of commercially viable vaccine manufacturing in Africa.\n\nSourcing MCMs from African manufacturers. The United States is sourcing MCMs from African producers to address African needs through programs such as the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) and the President’s Malaria Initiative (PMI). PEPFAR aims to procure 15 million HIV tests produced in Africa by 2025, and work alongside other partners to shift 2 million patients on first-line ARV treatments to African-produced products. Since 2023, PEPFAR has procured nearly 100,000 HIV tests from the Africa-based manufacturers towards that goal, and has worked with the World Health Organization (WHO), the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria (Global Fund) and Unitaid to launch an open Expert Review Panel for Diagnostics for African manufacturers of HIV rapid tests to accelerate the availability of HIV rapid tests produced in Africa. PMI is committed to building a more resilient supply chain and is leveraging its procurement volume to accelerate growth in African regional manufacturing. PMI is actively working, in coordination with partners like the Global Fund and Medicines for Malaria Ventures, to increase the number of African suppliers they procure from and their share of PMI’s total procurement. In FY 2023, PMI doubled the share of its procurements sourced from Africa to 10 percent.\n\nMedical supply chain studies in the Americas Region. Through the Americas Partnership for Economic Prosperity, the United States is working closely with the Inter-American Development Bank to carry out supply chain competitiveness studies in three critical sectors: clean energy, semiconductors, and medical supplies.\n\nProviding Vaccines, Tests and Treatments and Supporting Delivery\n\nThe Biden-Harris Administration provides MCMs for ongoing and emergency health threats, and makes significant long-term investments to support country readiness to receive, deliver and effectively use vaccines, tests, PPE and treatments. These investments range from bed nets to protect children and families from malaria, to ARVs for those living with HIV, to supporting skilled health workers, and to MCMs to support outbreak response. Examples include:\n\nProvision of HIV treatment. The PEPFAR program continues to support the African continent with the provision of more than $700 million in health commodities to African HIV programs in 2023, alongside the more than $2.1 billion in health commodities provided to Africa in 2023 through the Global Fund, to which the United States is the largest donor.   \n\nProvision of and improvement in Ebola treatments. Since the 2014-2016 outbreak of Ebola in West Africa, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response (ASPR) has worked with impacted nations to supply the standard-of-care treatments for Ebola patients. In 2018, HHS made existing therapeutics available to support the international response to the second largest Ebola outbreak in history, partnering with researchers in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) on a randomized controlled trial that demonstrated superior efficacy of two therapeutics. The United States has since made those treatments available to impacted nations and WHO in every outbreak of Ebola in Africa since 2018. This includes an outbreak in Guinea in February 2021 in which U.S.-supplied therapeutic doses were available for use in a remote Guinean treatment facility less than one week after the identification of the first case.\n\nPublic-private partnerships to deliver vaccines. Project Last Mile collaborates with regional Coca-Cola bottlers and suppliers to strengthen public health systems capacity in supply chain. This partnership between the Coca-Cola Company and Foundation, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, the Global Fund, and USAID applies Coca-Cola’s expertise in route-to-market, cold chain, and marketing for improved vaccine distribution and uptake. \n\nResponding to mpox outbreaks. The Biden-Harris Administration is currently working to make a vaccine available to African nations where mpox is endemic. For all donations, technical experts from ASPR, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and NIH are supporting the recipient nation in the development of vaccination strategies based on local epidemiology. Discussions about vaccine donations are ongoing with multiple countries, including DRC, which is responding to an unprecedented surge in mpox cases.\n\nSupporting access to medicines in Ukraine. Since the start of Russia’s full-scale war against Ukraine on February 24, 2022, the United States has focused on meeting Ukraine’s urgent needs, while maintaining support for long-term development goals. For example, in March 2022, USAID rapidly expanded support for Ukraine’s public health supply chain systems, enabling Ukraine to transparently and efficiently receive, distribute and account for more than $400 million in medicines and supplies donated from around the world during the first six months of the war, helping to sustain access to lifesaving medicines.\n\nExpanding Pandemic Response Financing\n\nSince Day One, the Biden-Harris Administration has prioritized transforming the global financing architecture to better support pandemic prevention, preparedness and response. One of the causes of disparities in delivery times for vaccines and medical countermeasures in the COVID-19 response was that many health organizations and national health systems lacked the capital they needed to place early orders with vaccine manufacturers. Ensuring funding is available to accelerate MCM access during health emergencies is vital for achieving health security.\n\nSupporting multilateral development bank (MDB) evolution. MDBs have a key role to play in helping countries address global challenges. The United States is working with other shareholders to evolve the visions, incentive structures, operational approaches, and financial capacity of the MDBs to equip these institutions to respond to transboundary global challenges with sufficient speed and scale. The United States and other shareholders have urged the World Bank to prioritize pandemics along with climate change and fragility, and in response it has expanded its crisis preparedness and response toolkit and announced a Global Challenge Program aimed at enhancing health emergency prevention, preparedness, and response.  The United States is also exploring how the World Bank can strengthen partnerships, enable coordinated and right-timed financing in the event of a pandemic, and help client countries assess critical pandemic preparedness gaps. \n\nG7 partnership on surge financing. The DFC is partnering with G7 DFIs to transform institutional capacity individually and collectively to effectively provide surge financing for procurement, production, and delivery of medical countermeasures in low- and middle-income countries. This partnership is working toward the launch of at least two new DFI-led and shared MCM surge financing facilities in 2024 and is working to develop viable options, with the G7 DFIs, including the European Investment Bank and IFC, to enhance pooled procurement instruments and delivery of tests, treatments, supplies and vaccines, by the end of 2024.\n\nSupport for Gavi’s Day Zero Financing Facility. The United States has supported Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance in establishing the Day Zero Financing Facility, a suite of tools that will mobilize, for example, up to $2 billion in risk-tolerant surge and contingent capital to enable Gavi to quickly meet the demand for vaccines in a pandemic. The United States also supports the roles of CEPI, the Global Fund, and other regional and multilateral organizations in the development of analogous capacity to surge financing for MCMs.\n\nSupport for the Access to COVID-19 Tools Accelerator (ACT-A). The United States was the world’s largest donor to ACT-A and provided global leadership to raise additional billions in critical funding through the U.S.-hosted and co-hosted Global COVID-19 Summits to save lives globally, end the pandemic, and build stronger health security.\n\nStrengthening Regulatory and Legal Systems\n\nUnder President Biden’s leadership, the United States is working to promote and strengthen global regulatory and legal systems to better prepare for health emergencies and otherwise ensure the safety, efficacy and accessibility of MCMs. Examples include:\n\nStrengthening regulatory systems. FDA advances multi-lateral and bilateral regulatory systems strengthening by providing technical support to FDA counterparts in foreign countries and international organizations as part of cooperative regulatory activities. The United States also actively engages in diverse multilateral health and regulatory forums such as the International Coalition of Medicines Regulatory Authorities, International Convention on Harmonization of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals of Human Use, and the International Medical Device Regulators Forum to inform internationally recognized technical guidance documents, standards and scientific principles, common or similar practices and procedures, related to MCMs. FDA also provides technical assistance to WHO’s efforts.\n\nSupport for the Legal Preparedness Action Package. The HHS Office of Global Affairs (OGA) and CDC co-Chair the Global Health Security Agenda (GHSA) Legal Preparedness Action Package to develop and promote guidance and capacity building tools on legal mapping, regulatory strengthening, and liability risk management with a network of experts from around the world to support efforts in strengthening legal preparedness, including to promote equitable access to medical countermeasures.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNational COVID-⁠19 Preparedness Plan\n\nToday, the U.S. government is releasing the National COVID-19 Preparedness Plan – which will enable America to move forward safely, sustaining and building on the progress we’ve made over the past 13 months. This plan lays out the roadmap to help us fight COVID-19 in the future as we begin to get back to our more normal routines. We look to a future when Americans no longer fear lockdowns, shutdowns, and our kids not going to school. It’s a future when the country relies on the powerful layers of protection we have built and invests in the next generation of tools to stay ahead of this virus.\n\nThe President’s National COVID-19 Preparedness Plan focuses on four key goals:\n\nProtect Against and Treat COVID-19\n\nThe United States has experienced five waves of the pandemic since 2020, including three in the past year that were driven by new variants. America experienced a wave of COVID-19 cases driven by the Alpha variant in early Spring 2021 – a time when the U.S. vaccination program was administering a record number of vaccines every day. The Delta variant, which was more than twice as contagious as the original coronavirus strain, then swept across the country starting in Summer 2021, beginning in the South and spreading to the Midwest and Rocky Mountain regions. \n\nOmicron represented another step in the virus’s evolution, and has been one of the most contagious viruses in history, causing record numbers of infections around the world over the past three months. However, because of both lower severity of the Omicron variant and a stronger level of population immunity from vaccinations, Omicron has caused relatively fewer cases of severe COVID-19. Compared to prior waves of COVID-19 in the United States, the Omicron wave has had a lower proportion of cases resulting in hospitalization or death. \n\nAmerica has weathered the current Omicron wave with minimal disruption – schools and businesses largely remained open. As the country emerges from the Omicron wave, our path forward relies on maintaining and continually enhancing the numerous tools we now have to protect ourselves and our loved ones – from vaccines, to tests, to treatments, to masks, and more. \n\nIn January 2021, Americans had very few tools to protect against COVID-19, and the tools we did have were in limited supply. Over the last year, together, with states, localities, and public and private partners, the Administration has mobilized an unprecedented, whole-of-society effort to give Americans the tools they need to protect themselves. \n\nThe Administration has put vaccines at the center of our COVID-19 response because vaccines are the best tool we have to prevent hospitalization and death. We stood up the largest free vaccination program in our country’s history – mobilizing 90,000 vaccination locations, standing up dozens of federally-run mass vaccination sites with the ability to administer more than a combined 125,000 shots a day, and deploying over 9,000 federal personnel to support vaccinations nationwide – including over 5,000 active duty troops. \n\nAs a result, today, the vast majority of Americans have the protection of a vaccine – with 215 million Americans fully vaccinated, and an estimated two-thirds of eligible adults having received their booster shot. Vaccinated and boosted people are 41 times less like to die of COVID-19 than unvaccinated individuals. And America’s unprecedented vaccination campaign has saved lives: a December 2021 estimate suggested that vaccines saved over 1 million American lives and successfully prevented over 10 million hospitalizations. \n\nThe Administration has also expedited the development, manufacturing, and procurement of COVID-19 treatments, building a diverse medicine cabinet filled with more treatments now than at any point in the pandemic.  Today about 4 million treatment courses are available to Americans, with 1 million additional courses of the Pfizer antiviral available in March, and another 2.5 million additional courses of the Pfizer antiviral available in April. In total, we have secured 20 million courses of Pfizer’s life-saving antiviral pills, which have been shown to reduce the risk of hospitalization or death by 89%. \n\nThe nation’s testing supply has increased dramatically. We now have free testing sites at 21,500 locations around the country. In January 2021, there were no rapid, at-home tests on the market available to Americans; during January 2022, there were more than 480 million at-home tests available to Americans on top of all other testing options. And we stood up COVIDtests.gov so Americans could order tests that shipped directly to their homes — for free. Private insurance and Medicaid now cover rapid at-home tests for free, and Medicare will fully cover these at-home tests starting this spring. \n\nAnd the U.S. government has successfully put equity at the heart of a nationwide public health response. Hispanic, Black, and Asian adults are now vaccinated at the same rates as White adults. This is the result of an all-of-society effort that got America to where it is today: employers who offered paid time off for their employees; child care providers who offered drop-in services for caregivers to get vaccinated; public transit authorities and ride-sharing companies that provided free rides to vaccination sites; churches, civic organizations, barbershops, and beauty salons, who opened their doors to be trusted spaces for vaccinations; and the families who made vaccination a family affair.  \n\nThe path forward in the fight against COVID-19 is clear: we must maintain and continually enhance the tools we have to protect against and treat COVID-19. The Administration looks forward to working with Congress to ensure that we have the resources to do just that. \n\nBecause we have these tools, we can begin to get back to our more normal routines safely and the use of public health mitigation measures like masking can be less frequent. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has updated its framework for recommendations on preventive measures like masking, so masks are recommended when and where they matter the most and Americans will be wearing masks less often. \n\nMake no mistake, as America moves forward we will leave no one behind. Equity will remain at the very center of our path forward in the fight against COVID-19. And we will be there to support Americans with the long-term impacts of COVID-19, including people experiencing Long COVID or mental and behavioral health challenges; as well as families suffering from the tragedy of losing someone they loved.\n\nThe Administration will work with Congress to secure the necessary funding to:\n\nLaunch an effort to vaccinate America’s youngest children as soon as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) authorizes and the CDC recommends a vaccine for that age group.\n\nIf the FDA authorizes and CDC recommends a vaccine for children . If the FDA authorizes and the CDC recommends a vaccine for children under five years of age, the United States is prepared to immediately distribute vaccines through a network of thousands of pediatricians’ offices, children’s hospitals, health centers, and local sites, so that vaccines are made available conveniently to families across the country.\n\nEnsure that Americans – of all ages – can get the protection of an effective vaccine.\n\nTo ensure that people stay protected, the U.S. government will The Administration will continue to ensure that all Americans have ready access to free and safe vaccines, because vaccines are the most effective defense against COVID-19. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) will also continue to monitor the efficacy and durability of currently authorized vaccines against current and future variants and make recommendations to optimize protection.\n\nIncrease American manufacturing capacity to reliably produce an additional 1 billion vaccine doses per year – three times the U.S. population – and accelerate research and development of a single COVID vaccine that protects against SARS-CoV-2 and all its variants, as well as previous SARS-origin viruses.\n\nTo ensure that people stay protected, the U.S. government will continue to use advance purchasing agreements when appropriate and work closely with vaccine manufacturers to produce shots quickly and safely. Fully supporting this effort to scale up domestic vaccine manufacturing will require additional resources from Congress. Additionally, we will maintain a network of tens of thousands of sites to deliver shots to the American people at any time this effort is needed.\n\nContinue vaccination outreach and education efforts and combat misinformation and disinformation.\n\nHHS will continue its work to equip Americans with the tools to identify misinformation and to invest in longer-term efforts to build resilience against health misinformation.\n\nEnsure there are enough treatments for every American who needs them.\n\nThe U.S. government will procure additional treatments; continue to use an expedited, streamlined process to review treatments for authorization by the FDA; and accelerate research and development into next generation treatments. These efforts will require additional funding and authorities from Congress.\n\nLaunch a nationwide Test to Treat Initiative so Americans can rapidly access treatment, including by visiting a “one-stop” location to get a free test and free treatment pills.\n\nThe Administration will put forth new educational efforts for the public and providers so that Americans can rapidly access treatments. The Administration will establish “One-Stop Test to Treat” locations at pharmacy-based clinics, community health centers, Long-Term Care Facilities, and the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) facilities across the country. “One-stop” sites will be operational by March. \n\nUpdate the framework for recommendations on preventive measures like masking to reflect the current state of the disease.\n\nMasks have been a critical tool to protect ourselves, but they have a time and a place. With a broad range of other protective tools in place, the CDC has announced an updated framework for guidance on preventive measures like masking – moving away from simply basing broad recommendations on case counts and test positivity, and instead encouraging prevention measures like masking when they are most needed to minimize severe disease and to keep our hospitals from becoming overwhelmed in times when COVID-19 is surging. By monitoring community risk, masks can be worn when the risk of severe disease in the community is high and taken off when the risk is low. Overall, it means Americans will be wearing masks less because so many people are protected from severe disease.\n\nLaunch a one-stop-shop website that allows Americans to easily find public health guidance based on the COVID-⁠19 risk in their local area and access tools to protect themselves.\n\nThe Administration will launch a website where Americans can find the level of COVID-19 risk in their community and specific guidance based on that risk. The site will also point people to the tools we now have to fight COVID-19, such as locating a vaccination site in their neighborhood or finding a free high-quality mask at a local grocery store or pharmacy.\n\nSustain and increase American manufacturing of COVID-⁠19 tests, so we can continue to have a robust supply of tests.\n\nThe Administration will continue to use the expedited authorization process to help test manufacturers get tests to market quickly; maintain America’s network of thousands of free testing sites; use the Defense Production Act (DPA) and other authorities, where warranted, to increase manufacturing capacity; and invest in innovation to make tests less expensive. These continued investments in testing will require additional funding from Congress.\n\nPrioritize protections for the immunocompromised and take new actions to protect people with disabilities and older adults.\n\nThe Administration will continue to provide strong support for the immunocompromised, including providing prioritized access to treatments and preventive interventions – pending additional funding from Congress – as well as ensuring access to boosters. The Administration will also increase equitable access to testing and COVID-19 mitigation resources for people with disabilities and older adults, and engage industry to accelerate research and development of accessible self-tests. Securing sufficient preventive treatments for people who are immunocompromised will require additional funding from Congress.\n\nHelp Americans with the long-term impacts of COVID-⁠19.\n\nIn recognition of the wide-reaching long-term impacts of COVID-19 on our society, the President will direct the U.S. government to accelerate efforts to detect, prevent, and treat Long COVID; coordinate efforts to provide support to families who have experienced the COVID-related loss of a loved one; and attend to the mental health and well-being of our communities. The Administration will also propose to make new investments in health care workers to support their mental health and well-being.\n\nEnsure equitable access to COVID-⁠19 health care and public health resources.\n\n The Administration will continue to prioritize providing equitable access to COVID-19 health care and public health resources – including personal protective equipment (PPE), tests, treatments, masks, and vaccines; and address COVID-related health inequities among communities defined by race, ethnicity, geography, disability, sexual orientation, gender identity, and other factors. The U.S. government will support dedicated resources for local community-based organizations, community health centers, and rural health clinics.\n\n\n\nPrepare for New Variants\n\nAs we work to keep ourselves protected against COVID-19, America must remain prepared for any new variant that may come our way. To do so, the Administration has developed a comprehensive plan for how we monitor this virus to stay ahead of it, adapt our tools swiftly to combat a new variant, and deploy emergency resources to help communities.\n\nBefore January 2021, the federal government had insufficient data and sequencing capabilities and was ill-equipped to respond to new variants. Electronic case reporting was in place for only a handful of states in 2020 and the country could sequence only 3,000 viral isolates per week. America had no plan for responding to a new variant or standing up comprehensive efforts to respond to a surge in COVID-19 cases.   \n\nThe Administration has enhanced our collection, production, and analysis of data, and expanded electronic case reporting to all 50 states, Washington D.C., Puerto Rico, and thousands of health care facilities. The CDC now tracks a range of key COVID-19 response metrics including cases, tests, vaccinations, and hospital admissions in real-time. Additionally, the CDC launched – and is continually enhancing – the National Wastewater Surveillance System (NWSS) to track the presence of SARS-COV-2 in wastewater samples collected across the country. And America has established a world-class sequencing operation, sequencing up to 90,000 isolates a week. The CDC’s sequencing efforts can now reliably detect variants that account for as little as 0.1% of all COVID-19 cases circulating in the United States. And when new variants are identified, the federal government has a network of researchers – federal, academic, and commercial – who are able to study the sequence and assess mutations rapidly, allowing the government to respond quickly to concerning variants.  \n\nThe Administration has also successfully built a robust emergency response infrastructure. Our surge response – led by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and HHS – developed capabilities to stand up over 100 federal mass vaccination sites and federal surge testing sites; distribute millions of critical supplies; and deploy thousands of federal clinical and non-clinical personnel to support states, Tribes, and territories. Since July 2021, the federal government has deployed over 4,000 military and non-military personnel including doctors, nurses, and paramedics; sent over 3,400 ventilators, ambulances, and other critical supplies; and shipped over 115 million pieces of PPE. And over the last year, FEMA has invested $300 million in state hospital preparedness to expand hospital capacity in 38 states. \n\nMoving forward, the Administration will maintain our proven data, sequencing, variant response, and surge response capabilities. The CDC will continue to improve COVID-19 data collection, reporting, and analysis so America is better informed and ready to respond to new variants. And if new variants emerge, the federal government will leverage established playbooks to assess a new variant’s impact on our vaccines, treatments, and tests, and rapidly deploy the tools, personnel, and resources Americans need. America will also retain a significant stockpile of tools to combat COVID-19 that remain ready for deployment.\n\nThe Administration will work with Congress to secure the necessary funding to:\n\nImprove our data collection, sequencing, and wastewater surveillance capabilities to immediately identify and detect new and emerging variants; and strengthen pandemic preparedness.\n\nThe U.S. government will continue improvements to COVID-19 The U.S. government will continue improvements to COVID-19 disease and vaccination data collection, wastewater surveillance, and virus sequencing capacity so we are better prepared to respond rapidly to emerging threats. This includes strengthening data infrastructure and interoperability so that more jurisdictions can link case surveillance and hospital data to vaccine data. The Administration is also leveraging COVID-19 response capabilities into stronger pandemic preparedness.\n\nLeverage a COVID-⁠19 Variant Playbook to determine the impact of a new variant on our vaccines, treatments, and tests, and shore up and update our tools, if needed.\n\nThe Administration has developed a variant playbook to rapidly assess the disease severity and transmissibility of a new variant, and to expedite the rapid laboratory evaluation of the effectiveness of vaccines, tests, and treatments against any variant. The U.S. The Administration has developed a variant playbook to assess the disease severity and transmissibility of a new variant immediately, and to expedite the rapid laboratory evaluation of the effectiveness of vaccines, tests, and treatments against any variant. The U.S. government has also developed a series of plans in coordination with manufacturers for the accelerated development, approval, manufacturing, and delivery of updated vaccines, tests, and treatments. These expedited plans and processes suggest that updated vaccines can be deployed in 100 days instead of many months or years.  \n\nUtilize new FDA processes to expedite regulatory review of variant-specific versions of vaccines and treatments, so America can get them in place, if needed.\n\nFDA has developed new processes to accelerate the authorization and approval of a vaccine or treatment that targets any new variant while maintaining strict and longstanding practices to ensure the safety and efficacy of the products.\n\nSupport new FDA processes to expedite regulatory review of variant-specific versions of vaccines and treatments, so Americans can get them quickly if needed.\n\nFDA has developed new approaches to accelerate the authorization of a vaccine or treatment that targets any new variant while maintaining strict and longstanding practices to ensure the safety and efficacy of the products.\n\nLeverage a proven COVID-⁠19 Surge Response Playbook.\n\nThe Administration has developed a comprehensive emergency response COVID-19 surge playbook to stand up mass vaccination and testing sites, expedite deployments of surge medical and emergency personnel, expand hospitals and emergency facilities, and provide emergency supplies.\n\nAdd at-home tests, antiviral pills, and masks for the general population to America’s stockpile for the first time.\n\nAmerica will stockpile new categories of supplies including at-home tests, antiviral pills, and masks for the general population for the first time. The Administration will also maintain a fully stocked Strategic National Stockpile (SNS) with an inventory of masks, ventilators, gloves, gowns, and hospital equipment. The U.S. government will be ready to deploy supplies to the American people to ensure adequate supply in times of surges, COVID-19 outbreaks, or new variants.\n\nThe U.S. government has established a permanent logistics and operational hub at HHS to ensure accelerated development, production, and delivery of COVID-⁠19 vaccines and treatments.\n\nThe Administration has transitioned an emergency logistics and operational organization into a permanent agency structure at HHS, which has allowed the Administration to build on its progress, retain expertise and skills, and continue providing the necessary tools to the American people during this pandemic and for any future disease outbreaks.\n\n\n\nPrevent Economic and Educational Shutdowns\n\nOur path forward relies on giving schools and businesses the tools they need to prevent economic and educational shutdowns, so that our students can remain safe in school, our workers can be safe at work, and our economy can continue to grow. \n\nAt the beginning of last year, America was experiencing widespread school and business shutdowns: only 46% of K-12 schools were open for in-person learning, and millions of businesses had closed and tens of millions of Americans had lost their jobs in 2020. Throughout the last year, the Administration worked to provide schools, child care providers, and businesses with the necessary tools and resources to safely open, while keeping our children, students, and workers safe. \n\nThe Administration provided a historic investment of $130 billion from the American Rescue Plan to reopen schools by improving school ventilation, accessing tests, and hiring more teachers, nurses, and staff. To protect workers and keep our businesses open, the Administration launched the largest vaccination campaign in history – working hand-in-hand with the business community; and requiring vaccinations where we could, including for federal workers.\n\nToday, about 99% of K-12 schools are open for in-person learning. And since President Biden took office, there has been historic job growth. The U.S. economy created 6.6 million jobs in 2021 – the strongest job growth of any year on record – and grew 5.7% in 2021, the fastest pace of economic growth in nearly four decades. The U.S. was also the first major economy to exceed its pre-pandemic economic output. \n\nThe path forward in the fight against COVID-19 is clear: schools, workers, and workplaces have resources and guidance to prevent shutdowns.\n\nThe Administration will work with Congress to secure the necessary funding to:\n\nGive schools and businesses guidance, tests, and supplies to stay open, including tools to improve ventilation and air filtration.\n\nThe U.S. government will also provide a Clean Air in Buildings Checklist that all buildings can use to improve indoor ventilation and air filtration and will encourage uptake of ventilation improvements. The Administration will also provide technical assistance that encourages schools, public buildings, and state, local, and Tribal governments to make ventilation improvements and upgrades using American Rescue Plan funds.\n\nWork with Congress to provide paid sick leave to workers who need to miss work due to a case of COVID-⁠19 or to care for a loved one who has COVID-⁠19.\n\nThe Administration will work with Congress to reinstate tax credits to help small- and mid-size businesses provide paid sick and family leave to deal with COVID-related absences.\n\nUpdate guidance for employers to ensure safer workplaces.\n\nThe Department of Labor’s Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) will update workplace guidance to better equip employers with the tools they need to ensure safe workplaces, including guidance on how employers can continue to support increased vaccination and boosting of their employees; support workers such as people who are immunocompromised who choose to wear high-quality masks; limit workplace-based infections; and enhance ventilation.\n\nEngage early care and education providers to help them remain safely open and help parents return to work with peace of mind.\n\nEarly care and education providers, including child care centers, family child care providers, pre-K and more, have been essential in our fight against COVID-19. The Administration invested $40 billion in American Rescue Plan funds to states, territories, and Tribes to help child care providers and Head Start grantees keep their doors open and provide safe care that is crucial for parents getting back to work. Building on this funding, the Administration will continue to engage the community of early care and education providers to ensure they have tools and support to stay safely open and to continue supporting our families.\n\nWith the vast majority of federal workers at their workplaces, substantially expand levels of services at public-facing federal offices (like local Social Security offices).\n\nCOVID-19 no longer needs to dictate how we work. Federal agencies will lead by example, increasing the hours public-facing federal offices are open for in-person appointments and in-person interactions in the month of April.\n\n\n\nContinue to Lead the Effort to Vaccinate the World and Save Lives\n\nFighting this virus abroad is key to America’s effort to protect people and stay ahead of new variants. To do so, we will continue to lead in providing vaccines to the world, helping to get those vaccines into arms, and deploying emergency supplies to countries experiencing surges in COVID-19. We will also continue to advance sustainable capacity and financing for health security to fight COVID-19 variants.\n\nThe President committed that the United States would be the world’s arsenal for vaccines – both because it’s the right thing to do and in our collective interest. And America is delivering on that commitment. The United States stands alone in procuring 1 billion vaccines for the sole purpose of donating them. And overall, the Administration has committed to donating 1.2 billion doses to other countries – for free, with zero strings attached, which represents the largest commitment of any single country or group of countries in the world. As of today, the U.S. government has delivered over 475 million free doses to 112 countries around the world – four times the number of free doses shared with the world than any other country. \n\nIn addition, the U.S. government has delivered life-saving resources like oxygen, treatments, PPE, and other essential supplies worth more than $1 billion to countries experiencing outbreaks. U.S. government public health experts from the CDC, U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), the U.S. Department of State (State), HHS and the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) and other entities are working side-by-side with on-the-ground providers, providing technical assistance in vaccine program implementation, care provision, and outbreak investigation. We have increased the world’s capacity to manufacture vaccines and have fostered an enabling environment for innovation, including by spurring African manufacturing.\n\nOver the last year, the Biden Administration pioneered the model to donate and deliver surplus vaccines to the rest of the world. America was the first country to announce a purchase of doses solely for donation to other countries; the first country to give up our place in line for vaccines – allowing the African Union to immediately start receiving up to 110 million doses of Moderna at a reduced rate negotiated by the United States; and the first country to negotiate a deal to send vaccines directly to humanitarian settings and conflict zones to vaccinate displaced persons. The path forward in the pandemic will require doubling down on our commitment to help vaccinate the globe and to save lives by making tests, treatments, and PPE widely available.\n\nThe Administration will work with Congress to secure the necessary funding to:\n\nLeverage the vaccine donation model America pioneered to deliver the 1.2 billion doses we committed to donate to the rest of the world.\n\nAmerica will continue to deliver the 1.2 billion doses we committed to donate to countries in need, continuing to leverage the partnerships the U.S. government built to donate and deliver vaccines to the rest of the world.\n\nIncrease efforts to get shots in arms around the world.\n\nThe U.S. government will increase investment in the Initiative for Global Vaccine Access (Global VAX), an ambitious global vaccination initiative to get doses into arms by working with partner countries to more quickly implement their plans. This includes supporting efforts such as jumpstarting communications campaigns, providing and supporting vaccinators on the front lines, purchasing cold chain supplies and syringes, paying for shipping and logistics to expedite vaccine delivery to hard-to-reach areas, ensuring people at high risk of hospitalization and deaths like the elderly and immunocompromised are vaccinated, and building vaccine confidence on the ground. Expanded global shots-in-arms efforts will require additional funding from Congress.\n\nSave lives by solving the oxygen crisis and making emergency supplies widely available.\n\nThe U.S. government will make oxygen and PPE available; enhance testing; provide treatments; strengthen global health systems to fight COVID-19; protect health workers from COVID-19 and essential health services from COVID-19 disruptions; improve detection, monitoring and mitigation of new COVID-19 variants; and increase regional and local manufacturing of countermeasures. These continued investments will require additional funding from Congress.\n\nContinue global leadership on the COVID-⁠19 response and build better health security for the future.\n\n The U.S. government will continue to work to build better capacity to fight COVID-19, manage future variants, and advance health security and preparedness for future pandemics. America is committed to establishing a new health security financial intermediary fund at the World Bank in 2022, and we call on all countries and public and private organizations to commit to urgent action to assist in the global COVID-19 response."

Two Vietnamese men, aged 32 and 49, were arrested while working as odd-job workers.\n\nThe illegal workers were charged at the Shatin Magistrates' Courts on September 19 with taking employment after landing in Hong Kong unlawfully and remaining in Hong Kong without the authority of the Director of Immigration, and taking employment while being a person in respect of whom a removal order or deportation order was in force respectively. They pleaded guilty to the charges and were sentenced to 15 months' imprisonment. Meanwhile, one of the males was also charged with one count of remaining in Hong Kong without the authority of the Director after landing in Hong Kong unlawfully. He was sentenced to 15 months' imprisonment, with parts of the sentences to run consecutively, making a total of 18 months' imprisonment.\n\nThe ImmD spokesman warned that, as stipulated in section 38AA of the Immigration Ordinance, an illegal immigrant, a person who is the subject of a removal order or a deportation order, an overstayer or a person who was refused permission to land is prohibited from taking any employment, whether paid or unpaid, or establishing or joining in any business. Offenders are liable upon conviction to a maximum fine of $50,000 and up to three years' imprisonment. Under the prevailing laws, it is an offence to use or possess a forged Hong Kong identity card or a Hong Kong identity card related to another person. Offenders are liable to prosecution and upon conviction face a maximum penalty of a $100,000 fine and up to 10 years' imprisonment.\n\nThe spokesman reiterated that it is a serious offence to employ people who are not lawfully employable. Under the Immigration Ordinance, the maximum penalty for an employer employing a person who is not lawfully employable, i.e. an illegal immigrant, a person who is the subject of a removal order or a deportation order, an overstayer or a person who was refused permission to land, has been significantly increased from a fine of $350,000 and three years' imprisonment to a fine of $500,000 and 10 years' imprisonment to reflect the gravity of such offences. The director, manager, secretary, partner, etc, of the company concerned may also bear criminal liability. The High Court has laid down sentencing guidelines that the employer of an illegal worker should be given an immediate custodial sentence.\n\nAccording to the court sentencing, employers must take all practicable steps to determine whether a person is lawfully employable prior to employment. Apart from inspecting a prospective employee's identity card, the employer has the explicit duty to make enquiries regarding the person and ensure that the answers would not cast any reasonable doubt concerning the lawful employability of the person. The court will not accept failure to do so as a defence in proceedings. It is also an offence if an employer fails to inspect the job seeker's valid travel document if the job seeker does not have a Hong Kong permanent identity card. Offenders are liable upon conviction to a maximum fine of $150,000 and to imprisonment for one year. In that connection, the spokesman would like to remind all employers not to defy the law by employing illegal workers. The ImmD will continue to take resolute enforcement action to combat such offences.\n\nUnder the existing mechanism, the ImmD will, as a standard procedure, conduct an initial screening of vulnerable persons, including illegal workers, illegal immigrants, sex workers and foreign domestic helpers, who are arrested during any operation with a view to ascertaining whether they are trafficking in persons (TIP) victims. When any TIP indicator is revealed in the initial screening, the officers will conduct a full debriefing and identification by using a standardised checklist to ascertain the presence of TIP elements, such as threats and coercion in the recruitment phase and the nature of exploitation. Identified TIP victims will be provided with various forms of support and assistance, including urgent intervention, medical services, counselling, shelter, temporary accommodation and other supporting services. The ImmD calls on TIP victims to report crimes to the relevant departments immediately.\n\nhe Immigration Department (ImmD) mounted a series of territory-wide anti-illegal worker operations codenamed \"Contribute\" and \"Twilight\", and joint operations with the Hong Kong Police Force codenamed \"Champion\" and \"Windsand\", on September 16, 17, and yesterday (September 19). A total of 16 suspected illegal workers and one suspected employer were arrested.\n\nDuring the anti-illegal worker operations, ImmD Task Force officers raided 21 target locations including commercial buildings, a food factory, premises under renovation and restaurants. Fourteen suspected illegal workers and one suspected employer were arrested. The arrested suspected illegal workers comprised eight men and six women, aged 27 to 55. Among them, one man was a holder of recognisance form, which prohibits him from taking any employment. In addition, one man was suspected of using and being in possession of a forged Hong Kong identity card. One man, aged 40, was suspected of employing the illegal worker and was also arrested.\n\nDuring operation \"Champion\", enforcement officers raided 10 target locations in Central district. Two suspected illegal workers were arrested. The arrested suspected illegal workers comprised two women, aged 37 and 56. They were also suspected of using and being in possession of a forged Hong Kong identity card.\n\nAn ImmD spokesman said, \"Any person who contravenes a condition of stay in force in respect of him or her shall be guilty of an offence. Also, visitors are not allowed to take employment in Hong Kong, whether paid or unpaid, without the permission of the Director of Immigration. Offenders are liable to prosecution and upon conviction face a maximum fine of $50,000 and up to two years' imprisonment. Aiders and abettors are also liable to prosecution and penalties.\"\n\nThe spokesman warned, \"As stipulated in section 38AA of the Immigration Ordinance, an illegal immigrant, a person who is the subject of a removal order or a deportation order, an overstayer or a person who was refused permission to land is prohibited from taking any employment, whether paid or unpaid, or establishing or joining in any business.

A Paskitani man, aged 30, was arrested while assembling the hawker pitch. Upon identity checking, he produced a recognisance form issued by the ImmD for inspection, which prohibits him from taking employment. Further investigation revealed that he was a non-refoulement claimant.\n\nThe illegal worker was charged at Shatin Magistrates' Courts yesterday with taking employment while being a person in respect of whom a removal order or deportation order was in force. After trial, he was sentenced to 22 months and two weeks' imprisonment.\n\nThe ImmD spokesman warned that, as stipulated in section 38AA of the Immigration Ordinance, an illegal immigrant, a person who is the subject of a removal order or a deportation order, an overstayer or a person who was refused permission to land is prohibited from taking any employment, whether paid or unpaid, or establishing or joining in any business.

Six Indonesian females, aged between 33 to 46, were arrested while working as cleaning workers on different floors of the plant. Upon enquiry, they were found to be former foreign domestic helpers and have overstayed in Hong Kong. An employer suspected of employing the six illegal workers was also arrested and the investigation is ongoing.\n\nThe six arrested illegal workers were charged at the Shatin Magistrates' Courts yesterday with taking employment while being a person who, having been given permission to land in Hong Kong, had remained in Hong Kong in breach of their limit of stay imposed in relation to the permission and overstaying in Hong Kong. They pleaded guilty to all charges and were sentenced to a total of 15 months' imprisonment respectively.\n\nAn ImmD spokesman warned that, \"As stipulated in section 38AA of the Immigration Ordinance, an illegal immigrant, a person who is the subject of a removal order or a deportation order, an overstayer or a person who was refused permission to land is prohibited from taking any employment, whether paid or unpaid, or establishing or joining in any business.

The ImmD calls on TIP victims to report crimes to the relevant departments immediately.\n\n\n\nThe Immigration Department (ImmD) announced that the Advance Passenger Information (API) System was implemented today (September 3).\n\nTo meet the aviation security requirements of the Convention on International Civil Aviation and to align Hong Kong with other aviation hubs worldwide, as well as to enable the ImmD to further enhance its passenger clearance and enforcement capabilities to prevent undesirables, including potential non-refoulement claimants, from boarding flights heading to Hong Kong, the ImmD implemented the API System today, requiring aircraft operators to comply with the Immigration (Advance Passenger Information) Regulation (Cap. 115Q) by transmitting advance information to the ImmD about flights and passengers heading to Hong Kong.\n\nAn ImmD spokesman said, \"During check-in for a flight heading to Hong Kong, the aircraft operator will capture the required API data from a traveller's travel document and transmit the API data of each traveller and the aircraft information to the API System, which will instantly process the information and provide a response message, i.e. a board or no-board direction, for each traveller back to the aircraft operator. The aircraft operator shall act upon the direction given through the API System, i.e. to allow or not allow specific travellers to board the aircraft heading to Hong Kong.\"\n\nTo allow sufficient time for over 100 aircraft operators to connect to the API system and to ensure the system will run in a smooth and orderly manner, the rollout will be carried out in phases. A transitional period of around 12 months will also be adopted. The offences and defences, and the miscellaneous provisions under Parts 4 and 5 of the Regulation will come into effect after the transitional period, starting from September 1, 2025.\n\nThe spokesman emphasised, \"The freedom to travel and the right of Hong Kong residents to enter or leave Hong Kong are guaranteed under Article 31 of the Basic Law and Article 8 of the Hong Kong Bill of Rights as set out in the Hong Kong Bill of Rights Ordinance (Cap.383). Such freedom and right are not affected by the implementation of the API System. The API system will not issue a no-board direction against Hong Kong permanent residents who enjoy the right of abode in Hong Kong.\"\n\n\n\nThe Immigration Department (ImmD) mounted a series of territory-wide anti-illegal worker operations, including one codenamed \"Twilight\" and a joint operation with the Hong Kong Police Force codenamed \"Champion\", for two consecutive days on August 28 and yesterday (August 29). A total of 12 suspected illegal workers and one suspected employer were arrested.\n\nDuring the anti-illegal worker operations, ImmD officers raided 12 target locations including premises under renovation, residential buildings and restaurants. Six suspected illegal workers were arrested. The arrested suspected illegal workers comprised two men and four women, aged 29 to 50. Among them, one woman was a holder of recognisance form, which prohibits her from taking any employment. In addition, the woman was also suspected of using and being in possession of forged Hong Kong identity cards.\n\nDuring operation \"Champion\", enforcement officers raided 33 target locations in Eastern District. Six suspected illegal workers and one suspected employer were arrested. The arrested suspected illegal workers comprised four men and two women, aged 26 to 59. Furthermore, one woman, aged 43, was suspected of employing the illegal workers and was also arrested.\n\nAn ImmD spokesman said, \"Any person who contravenes a condition of stay in force in respect of him or her shall be guilty of an offence. Also, visitors are not allowed to take employment in Hong Kong, whether paid or unpaid, without the permission of the Director of Immigration. Offenders are liable to prosecution and upon conviction face a maximum fine of $50,000 and up to two years' imprisonment. Aiders and abettors are also liable to prosecution and penalties.\"\n\nThe spokesman warned, \"As stipulated in section 38AA of the Immigration Ordinance, an illegal immigrant, a person who is the subject of a removal order or a deportation order, an overstayer or a person who was refused permission to land is prohibited from taking any employment, whether paid or unpaid, or establishing or joining in any business. Offenders are liable upon conviction to a maximum fine of $50,000 and up to three years' imprisonment. Under the prevailing laws, it is an offence to use or possess a forged Hong Kong identity card or a Hong Kong identity card related to another person. Offenders are liable to prosecution and upon conviction face a maximum fine of $100,000 and up to 10 years' imprisonment.\"\n\nThe spokesman reiterated that it is a serious offence to employ people who are not lawfully employable. Under the Immigration Ordinance, the maximum penalty for an employer employing a person who is not lawfully employable, i.e. an illegal immigrant, a person who is the subject of a removal order or a deportation order, an overstayer or a person who was refused permission to land, has been significantly increased from a fine of $350,000 and three years' imprisonment to a fine of $500,000 and 10 years' imprisonment to reflect the gravity of such offences. The director, manager, secretary, partner, etc, of the company concerned may also bear criminal liability. The High Court has laid down sentencing guidelines that the employer of an illegal worker should be given an immediate custodial sentence.\n\nAccording to the court sentencing, employers must take all practicable steps to determine whether a person is lawfully employable prior to employment. Apart from inspecting a prospective employee's identity card, the employer has the explicit duty to make enquiries regarding the person and ensure that the answers would not cast any reasonable doubt concerning the lawful employability of the person. The court will not accept failure to do so as a defence in proceedings. It is also an offence if an employer fails to inspect the job seeker's valid travel document if the job seeker does not have a Hong Kong permanent identity card. Offenders are liable upon conviction to a maximum fine of $150,000 and to imprisonment for one year. In that connection, the spokesman would like to remind all employers not to defy the law by employing illegal workers. The ImmD will continue to take resolute enforcement action to combat such offences.\n\nUnder the existing mechanism, the ImmD will, as a standard procedure, conduct an initial screening of vulnerable persons, including illegal workers, illegal immigrants, sex workers and foreign domestic helpers, who are arrested during any operation with a view to ascertaining whether they are trafficking in persons (TIP) victims. When any TIP indicator is revealed in the initial screening, the ImmD officers will conduct a full debriefing and identification by using a standardised checklist to ascertain the presence of TIP elements, such as threats and coercion in the recruitment phase and the nature of exploitation. Identified TIP victims will be provided with various forms of support and assistance, including urgent intervention, medical services, counselling, shelter or temporary accommodation and other supporting services. The ImmD calls on TIP victims to report crimes to the relevant departments immediately.\n\n\n\n\n\nA Bangladeshi illegal worker, holding a recognisance form, was jailed by the Shatin Magistrates' Courts yesterday (August 28).\n\nDuring an anti-illegal worker operation conducted on April 15, the Immigration Department (ImmD) investigators raided a vegetable stall in Tsim Sha Tsui District. A Bangladeshi man, aged 36, was arrested while working as an odd-job worker. Upon identity checking, he produced a recognisance form issued by the ImmD for inspection, which prohibits him from taking employment. Further investigation revealed that he was a non-refoulement claimant.\n\nThe illegal worker was charged at the Shatin Magistrates' Courts yesterday with taking employment while being a person in respect of whom a removal order or deportation order was in force. After trial, he was sentenced to 22 months and two weeks' imprisonment.\n\nThe ImmD spokesman warned that, as stipulated in section 38AA of the Immigration Ordinance, an illegal immigrant, a person who is the subject of a removal order or a deportation order, an overstayer or a person who was refused permission to land is prohibited from taking any employment, whether paid or unpaid, or establishing or joining in any business. Offenders are liable upon conviction to a maximum fine of $50,000 and up to three years' imprisonment.\n\nThe spokesman reiterated that it is a serious offence to employ people who are not lawfully employable.

The ImmD calls on TIP victims to report crimes to the relevant departments immediately.\n\n\n\nA Hong Kong court has remanded a teaching assistant who admitted to leaking university entrance exam questions on a mainland Chinese social media platform to help “pave the way” for the launch of her private tuition business.\n\nLau Kwan-hei pled guilty to one count of breach of secrecy when she appeared at Eastern Court on Wednesday.\n\nThe court heard that the 23-year-old had been an invigilator for the Diploma of Secondary Education’s English listening assessment that took place on April 13.\n\nInvigilators are required to sign a confidentiality agreement with the Hong Kong Examinations and Assessment Authority and are only allowed to keep answer books for teaching purposes, as long as they do not publicise them.\n\nUnder the username “Miss Lucy”, Lau posted two pages from the exam’s question and answer book on popular Instagram-like Xiaohongshu platform after the assessment, with a caption that asked users “which question did you choose?”\n\nThe authority on April 16 filed a report with police after the Xiaohongshu post started circulating on other social media platforms.\n\nThe defendant admitted to officers that she shared the questions to “pave the way for starting an online tuition business”.\n\nPrincipal Magistrate Don So Man-lung on Wednesday slammed Lau for taking advantage of her job and questioned why the prosecution had not charged her with another count of theft.\n\nBut prosecutors said invigilators were allowed to take such materials home.\n\nSo ordered Lau to be remanded in custody while the prosecution prepared a background report to help inform the court’s decision on sentencing on October 9.\n\n\n\nA screengrab of the now-deactivated Xiaohongshu account behind the DSE exam leak. Photo: Handout\n\nThe court has confiscated her phone. It was also told that Lau’s Xiaohongshu account had been taken down.\n\nScreenshots of the now-deactivated account found the user had claimed to have first arrived in the city as a secondary school student, held a bachelor’s degree from Hong Kong Shue Yan University and a master’s from the University of Hong Kong.\n\nThe user also wrote that she was currently a secondary school educator and taught online tutorial classes for students newly arrived from the mainland.\n\n\n\nHong Kong is expected to receive more tour groups from mainland China during this year’s National Day “golden week” holiday than in 2023, but industry leaders have said numbers are still unsatisfactory and called for better plans to attract more visitors.\n\nThe representatives made the call on Wednesday in a bid to boost tourism in the city as the sector faced challenges, such as trending solo and one-day trips.\n\nSara Leung Fong-yuen, chairwoman of the Hong Kong Tourism Industry Employees General Union, said the 850 mainland tour groups expected in Hong Kong during the National Day period were not satisfactory.\n\n“The situation is not ideal. There are more solo trips, as well as visitors on one-day journeys. There are not many tourists staying overnight in Hong Kong,” she told a radio programme.\n\n“During the ‘golden week’ holidays before 2018, 300 to 500 mainland tour groups visited Hong Kong every day, so it is not actually ideal when the estimated number cannot exceed 1,000 now,” she said.\n\nThe Travel Industry Council earlier estimated as many as 1.2 million mainland Chinese would visit the city during the holiday.\n\nThe council, a federation of trade associations, also predicted that the number of inbound tour groups could grow by nearly 10 per cent to 850 during the seven-day mainland holiday that starts on October 1.\n\nLeung noted that hotels still had vacancies over the holiday break, unlike the full bookings over the same period pre-Covid, while the number of non-shopping tours offered by travel agencies was also small.\n\nShe attributed the sluggish performance to the city’s weak attractiveness to tours and the growing number of solo and one-day trips among tourists, as well as the absence of a long-term plan for the tourism industry in Hong Kong.\n\n\n\nTourists visit the Tsim Sha Tsui waterfront. Photo: Jelly Tse\n\nThe Culture, Sports and Tourism Bureau is mapping out the city’s tourism development blueprint 2.0, which was scheduled to be released in the second half of this year.\n\nCaspar Tsui Ying-wai, executive director of the Federation of Hong Kong Hotel Owners, also said on the same radio programme that most visitors only made one-day trips, with a few joining tour groups.\n\n“There will be more customers, but overall, our retail and catering industries are expected to see the return on consumption drop by 10 per cent to 20 per cent,” he said.\n\nHe added that many restaurants would offer discounts and hotels would launch packages such as featuring fireworks shows on display during the holiday to attract visitors.\n\nThe Immigration Department said on Tuesday about 10.03 million people, including residents and tourists, would pass through the city’s sea, land and air crossings from Saturday to October 7.\n\nAbout 85 per cent of travellers are expected to use land crossings to Macau or neighbouring mainland cities.\n\nAuthorities said numbers were set to peak on National Day on October 1, with about 523,000 outbound and 632,000 inbound trips.\n\nHongkongers will be able to enjoy shopping vouchers, dining discounts and free rides on public transport as the city marks the 75th anniversary of the founding of the People’s Republic of China on October 1.\n\nIn addition to special deals at 3,000 eateries, the government earlier announced that about 400 activities would be held to celebrate National Day, including a fireworks display, drone shows and car parades.\n\nThe pair of giant pandas gifted by Beijing to Hong Kong are due to arrive in the city on Thursday, but they will not meet the public at least until December.\n\n\n\nHong Kong’s health minister has called on the public not to label people with psychiatric disorders, saying that violent incidents involving psych patients were “isolated cases.”Hong Kong should adopt a more inclusive attitude towards psychiatric patients and do its best to help them recover, Secretary for Health Lo Chung-mau told the press on Tuesday.\n\nLo’s remarks came around a week after a man was shot in the chest by a police officer called to handle a domestic dispute on September 15. The  38-year-old man, who had a long record of mental illness, was said to have been holding a 30-centimetre long knife and a pair of scissors. He later died in hospital.\n\nOn Tuesday, Lo was asked if there was any early identification system for schizophrenic patients whose condition was worsening, and the channels available to the patient’s family to seek help.\n\nThe health chief was also asked if contacting the police was the only option, and whether the government would consider setting up a mechanism for the Hospital Authority’s (HA) psychiatric department to handle violent patients together with police and community nursing services.\n\nLo said he would not comment on individual cases, but his staff and psychiatric nurses had been following the case, he said. The official went on to say that violent incidents were something that “everyone is unwilling to see,” and it was crucial for society not to label psychiatric patients.\n\n“Patients with psychiatric disorders do not necessarily have violent tendencies; these are just isolated cases,” Lo said in Cantonese.\n\nLo said that patients with psychiatric disorders required not only diagnosis and treatment by doctors, but also the assistance from nurses, social workers and other personnel. The HA currently provided integrated treatment in collaboration with other organisations and multidisciplinary teams, he added.\n\nPolice complaint\n\nLast Sunday, the widow and older brother of the deceased man filed a complaint at the Wan Chai police headquarters, questioning why the officer resorted to firing their gun after being called to handle a domestic dispute.\n\nThe widow told the press that she had repeatedly asked the police not to shoot and said she had contacted the police for assistance, not for them to “shoot my husband dead.”She also questioned why the force had not tried other means to de-escalate the situation before resorting to gunshots.\n\nPaul Yip, member of the Health Bureau’s Advisory Committee on Mental Health, said on TVB last Sunday that if the police learned that they were handling a case involving a psych patient, or could foresee a dangerous situation, they should step up defensive measures by wearing protective gear and use shields to avoid resorting to lethal weapons.\n\nHe added society should treat people with psychiatric disorders with empathy, while different sectors should improve their understanding of mental illness to handle relevant emergency situations more effectively.\n\n\n\nA Mainland male was charged at the Sha Tin Magistrates' Courts with making false representation to an Immigration Department (ImmD) staff member, breaching the condition of stay and failing to register and apply for an identity card, and was sentenced to four months' imprisonment and fined $800 on May 31.\n\nThe 39-year-old defendant was granted entry to work in Hong Kong as an imported worker. Subsequently, the contract was prematurely terminated but the defendant did not depart Hong Kong within 14 days after the contract was terminated. The defendant was intercepted when he presented himself for departure clearance at a control point on May 26, during which the defendant claimed to the ImmD staff that he had no idea about the termination of his contract. The ImmD staff cast doubt on his explanation and thus began an investigation against the defendant.\n\nIn the course of the investigation, the defendant admitted under caution that he was well aware of the termination of his contract and he was required to leave Hong Kong within 14 days after the termination, but he did not depart before the limitation of stay expired because he wished to sightsee in Hong Kong. Moreover, records revealed that the defendant failed to register and apply for an identity card. The defendant was subsequently charged with the offences of making false representation to ImmD staff, breaching the condition of stay and failing to register and apply for an identity card. The defendant pleaded guilty to the charges and was sentenced to a total of four months' imprisonment and fined $800 by the Sha Tin Magistrates' Courts on May 31.\n\nAn ImmD spokesman said, \"Under the laws of Hong Kong, any person who makes false representation to an Immigration officer commits an offence. Offenders are liable to prosecution and, upon conviction, subject to the maximum penalty of a fine of $150,000 and imprisonment for 14 years.\"\n\nThe spokesman warned, \"Any person who contravenes a condition of stay in force in respect of him shall be guilty of an offence. Also, visitors are not allowed to take employment in Hong Kong, whether paid or unpaid, without the permission of the Director of Immigration. Offenders are liable to prosecution and upon conviction face a maximum fine of $50,000 and up to two years' imprisonment. Aiders and abettors are also liable to prosecution and penalties.\"\n\nUnder the Registration of Persons Ordinance, all Hong Kong residents aged 11 or over (including those who have been permitted to stay in Hong Kong for more than 180 days) are required to register for an identity card within 30 days of his entering Hong Kong, except those who are exempted or excluded. Offenders are liable to prosecution and, upon conviction, subject to the maximum penalty of a fine at level 3 and imprisonment for one year.\n\n\n\nThe Immigration Department (ImmD) mounted a series of territory-wide anti-illegal worker operations codenamed \"Twilight\", and joint operations with the Hong Kong Police Force codenamed \"Champion\" and \"Windsand\", for four consecutive days from July 15 to yesterday (June 18). A total of nine suspected illegal workers and three suspected employers were arrested.\n\nDuring the anti-illegal worker operations, ImmD Task Force officers raided nine target locations including premises under renovation and restaurants. Five suspected illegal workers and one suspected employer were arrested. The arrested suspected illegal workers comprised two men and three women, aged 24 to 46. Among them, one man and one woman were holders of recognisance forms, which prohibit them from taking any employment. In addition, one man and one woman were suspected of using and being in possession of a forged Hong Kong identity card respectively. One man, aged 28, who was suspected of employing the illegal workers, was also arrested.\n\nDuring operation \"Champion\", enforcement officers raided 55 target locations in Central district, including massage parlours and restaurants. Four suspected illegal workers and two suspected employers were arrested. The arrested suspected illegal workers comprised two men and two women, aged 37 to 49. Among them, one woman was a holder of recognisance form, which prohibits her from taking any employment. In addition, one woman was suspected of using and being in possession of a forged Hong Kong identity card. Furthermore, two men, aged 47 and 63, were suspected of employing the illegal workers and were also arrested. Among them, three suspected illegal workers and one suspected employer were handled by the ImmD.\n\nAn ImmD spokesman said, \"Any person who contravenes a condition of stay in force in respect of him or her shall be guilty of an offence.

Under the Immigration Ordinance, the maximum penalty for an employer employing a person who is not lawfully employable, i.e. an illegal immigrant, a person who is the subject of a removal order or a deportation order, an overstayer or a person who was refused permission to land, has been significantly increased from a fine of $350,000 and three years' imprisonment to a fine of $500,000 and 10 years' imprisonment to reflect the gravity of such offences.

        "context": "BEIJING, September 30. On the occasion of celebrating the 75th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, the flower basket laying ceremony in memory of the people's heroes on Martyrs' Day was grandly held on Tiananmen Square in Beijing on the morning of the 30th. Party and state leaders Xi Jinping, Li Qiang, Zhao Leji, Wang Huning, Cai Qi, Ding Xuexiang, Li Xi, Han Zheng and others attended the ceremony together with representatives from all walks of life. On the magnificent Tiananmen Square, the bright five-star red flag flutters in the wind. In the center of the square, the giant flower basket \"Blessing the Motherland\" expresses good wishes for the prosperity of the motherland. On the north side of the towering Monument to the People's Heroes, two groups of flower beds are inlaid with 18 wreaths composed of fresh flowers such as white chrysanthemums, expressing the deep remembrance of all Chinese people for the heroes and martyrs. As it approached 10 o'clock, Party and state leaders Xi Jinping, Li Qiang, Zhao Leji, Wang Huning, Cai Qi, Ding Xuexiang, Li Xi, Han Zheng and others came to Tiananmen Square to attend the flower basket laying ceremony in memory of the people's heroes. In front of the monument, more than 2,400 representatives from all walks of life held flowers and stood in solemn formation. Among them are old soldiers and comrades in their eighties and nineties, relatives of martyrs wearing red ribbons on their chests, representatives of recipients of national medals and national honorary titles, representatives of models for ethnic unity and progress who have been commended, and energetic young students and children. The trumpeters of the Military Band of the Chinese People's Liberation Army sounded the \"Horn for Martyrs' Day\". The deep and loud sound of the horn brings people's memories back to the turbulent historical years. \"Honor guards, take positions!\" At the command, the honor guards of the three services marched forward with firm steps and stood at attention with guns in front of the monument. At exactly 10 o'clock, the flower basket laying ceremony in memory of the people's heroes officially began. The military band played the \"March of the Volunteers\", and everyone in the audience sang the national anthem of the People's Republic of China in unison. After the national anthem was sung, everyone stood in silence and observed a moment of silence for the martyrs who heroically sacrificed themselves for the Chinese people's liberation cause and the cause of building the republic. After the moment of silence, children holding flowers faced the Monument to the People's Heroes and sang \"We Are the Successors of Communism\" loudly and saluted with the Young Pioneers' salute. In front of the formation, nine large flower baskets presented in the name of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, the State Council, the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, the Central Military Commission, democratic parties, the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce and non-party patriots, people's organizations and people from all walks of life, old soldiers, comrades in arms and relatives of martyrs, and the Chinese Young Pioneers were arranged in a row. The words \"Eternal Glory to the People's Heroes\" written on the red satin ribbon of the flower baskets were particularly eye-catching. The military band played the affectionate \"Flower Offering Melody\". Eighteen honor guards steadily lifted the flower baskets and slowly walked towards the Monument to the People's Heroes and placed the flower baskets on the base of the monument. Xi Jinping and other party and state leaders ascended the base of the monument and stopped to gaze at the flower baskets. The bright anthurium, blooming lilies, and graceful oncidium express endless thoughts and lofty respects for the people's heroes. Xi Jinping stepped forward and carefully adjusted the satin ribbon of the flower basket. Subsequently, Xi Jinping and other party and state leaders slowly walked around and paid their respects to the Monument to the People's Heroes. Since the 18th National Party Congress, under the strong leadership of the Party Central Committee with Xi Jinping as the core, the Party, the military, and the people of all ethnic groups across the country have united as one, forged ahead with determination, adhered to integrity and innovation, promoted historic achievements and changes in various undertakings of the Party and the country, and opened up a new situation for socialism with Chinese characteristics in the new era. Embarking on a new journey, more than 1.4 billion Chinese people are carrying on the spirit of heroes and martyrs and drawing strength for progress. They are full of vigor and vitality and are writing a new chapter of the times by further comprehensively deepening reform, and making unremitting efforts to comprehensively promote the great cause of building a powerful country and rejuvenating the nation through Chinese-style modernization. Children and representatives of people from all walks of life also took turns to walk in front of the monument, present the flowers in their hands and pay their respects to the monument. The flower basket laying ceremony was presided over by Yin Li, member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee and secretary of the Beijing Municipal Party Committee. Members of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee and secretaries of the Central Secretariat, vice chairpersons of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, state councilors, president of the Supreme People's Court, procurator-general of the Supreme People's Procuratorate, vice chairpersons of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and members of the Central Military Commission attended the ceremony. Principal responsible comrades of relevant departments of the central Party, government, military and people's groups and Beijing Municipality, heads of central democratic parties, the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce and representatives of non-party personages, representatives of old soldiers, comrades in arms and relatives of martyrs in Beijing, representatives of recipients of meritorious honors, members of the national ethnic minority visiting delegation, and representatives of people from all walks of life in the capital participated in the ceremony. \n\nBEIJING, September 30 (Xinhua) -- The 19th issue of Qiushi magazine to be published on October 1 will carry an important article by Xi Jinping, general secretary of the Communist Party of China Central Committee, president of the state, and chairman of the Central Military Commission, titled \"Vigorously Promote the Great Spirit of Patriotism and Continuously Push Forward the Great Cause of Building a Powerful Country and National Rejuvenation.\" This is an excerpt of Xi Jinping's important remarks from November 2012 to May 2024. The article emphasizes that patriotism is the deepest and most enduring emotion in the world. Patriotism is the core of the Chinese nation's spirit and has inspired generations of Chinese people to strive unremittingly for the country's development and prosperity. For more than 5,000 years, the reason why the Chinese nation has been able to withstand countless unimaginable risks and tests and always maintain strong vitality, perpetuating and passing on the flame, is inseparable from the Chinese nation's profound and lasting patriotic tradition. Patriotism is a powerful spiritual motivation that inspires the Chinese people to safeguard national independence and dignity and move forward bravely in the torrent of history. It is a powerful engine that drives the ship of the Chinese nation to brave the wind and waves and move forward bravely. It is a magnificent banner that leads the Chinese people and the Chinese nation to burst out with tremendous historical power and overcome all difficulties and obstacles on the road ahead! The article points out that patriotism is concrete and realistic. In contemporary China, to promote patriotism, we must deeply understand that the leadership of the Communist Party of China and the socialist system in China must be adhered to for a long time and cannot be shaken; the socialism with Chinese characteristics opened up by the Communist Party of China leading the Chinese people must be adhered to for a long time and cannot be shaken; the major policy of the Communist Party of China and the Chinese people taking root in China's land, learning from the excellent achievements of human civilization, and realizing national development independently must be adhered to for a long time and cannot be shaken. Only by unifying patriotism with loving the Party, socialism and the country can patriotism be vivid and real. This is the most important manifestation of the patriotic spirit in contemporary China. The article points out that to promote the spirit of patriotism, patriotism education must be taken as the eternal theme. We must unify patriotism and socialism. We must safeguard national unity and ethnic unity. We must respect and inherit the history and culture of the Chinese nation. We must adhere to being based on the nation while facing the world.

It is the original aspiration when the CPPCC was established and the fundamental guarantee for the progress and development of the cause of the CPPCC. We must run through the leadership of the Party in all the work of the CPPCC and earnestly implement all the requirements of the Party Central Committee for the work of the CPPCC.\" The united front, armed struggle, and Party building are the three magic weapons formed by the Communist Party of China in the revolutionary struggle.

It has transformed the propositions of the Communist Party of China into extensive consensus and conscious actions of all sectors of society, and ensured that the decision-making and deployment of the Central Committee of the Communist Party are fully implemented in the CPPCC. Entering the new era, the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping as the core has comprehensively strengthened its leadership over the work of the CPPCC.

In consultation, it promotes extensive unity, advances multiparty cooperation, and practices people's democracy, fully reflecting the characteristics and advantages of China's socialist democracy in having more discussions when there are matters, having more discussions when there are problems, and having more discussions when doing things. Entering the new era, the CPPCC continuously expands the content and enriches the forms of consultation, and conducts special topic consultations, counterpart consultations, sectoral consultations, and consultations on the handling of proposals more flexibly and more frequently. It explores new forms such as online discussion of political affairs, remote consultations, and expert consultations to improve the effectiveness of consultations.

Now it has become a regular platform and an important brand of consultative democracy of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. \"The bimonthly consultative symposium, centering on the new requirements of increasing consultation density and improving consultation effectiveness, innovates while inheriting. It comprehensively uses various forms of consultative democracy. Based on sectors, with special topics as content, taking counterparts as links, and using symposiums as methods, it has created a new form of consultative democracy.\" Li Junru, former vice president of the Party School of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, commented. On April 26, 2024, the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference held a remote consultative meeting to discuss and deliberate on \"deepening the multi-scenario application of artificial intelligence and improving the high-quality development level of modern industries.\" On that day, 10 members of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and experts spoke respectively at the organs of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and in venues in Shanghai, Zhejiang, and Anhui, as well as in Beijing, Guangdong and other places through video links and other means.

Highlighting a \"depth\" character. Anchoring consultative discussion on the reform of the scientific and technological system. The 12th National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference held a biweekly consultative symposium on \"deepening the reform of the scientific and technological system and focusing on enhancing original innovation capabilities.\" The 13th National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference held a special consultative meeting on \"innovation-driven development.\" The 14th National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference held a special consultative session of the Standing Committee on \"improving the scientific and technological innovation system and accelerating the implementation of the innovation-driven development strategy.\" Focusing on democratic supervision on the issue of black soil. In 2021, a key research was conducted on the degradation of black soil. In 2022, attention was paid to protection investment, fund use management, and soil erosion control of black soil cultivated land. In 2023, the implementation of the \"Law of the People's Republic of China on the Protection of Black Soil\" was promoted. In 2024, emphasis was placed on strengthening scientific and technological support for protecting black soil. Conducting in-depth research on major decision-making arrangements. In 2023, major special research projects across committees and sectors were 聊聊新话题\n\nThis year marks the 75th anniversary of the founding of the CPPCC. Looking back on the magnificent journey, looking forward to a promising future, upholding the CPPCC system and developing the CPPCC cause well will surely inspire hundreds of millions of people to unite their strength, forge great achievements through struggle, and jointly write a magnificent chapter on the Chinese path to modernization.\nIn September 75 years ago, the first plenary session of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference was held amidst the triumph of the Chinese people's historic struggle for national independence and people's liberation. Over the past 75 years, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, the CPPCC has actively participated in the great practice of building a new China, building a new China, exploring the path of reform and realizing the Chinese dream, and has gone through a glorious course. Especially since the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, under the strong leadership of the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping as the core, the CPPCC has adhered to the two themes of unity and democracy, adhered to the nature of the CPPCC, and closely promoted the overall layout of the \"Five in One\", coordinated and promoted the \"Four Comprehensive\" strategic layout.\nPractice has shown that the CPPCC is a great achievement achieved by the Communist Party of China in integrating Marxist-Leninist united front theory, party theory, and democratic political theory with China's reality, and a great creation in the political system under the leadership of the Communist Party of China's democratic parties, non-partisan people, people's organizations, and people of all ethnic groups and all walks of life. As a united front organization, an institution for multi-party cooperation and political consultation, and an important form of people's democracy, the CPPCC is an important channel and specialized consultative body for socialist consultative democracy, an important part of the national governance system, and an institutional arrangement with Chinese characteristics. On the new journey of advancing the Chinese path to modernization, we must adhere to and improve the multi-party cooperation and political consultation system led by the Communist Party of China, adhere to the organic combination of party leadership, united front, and consultative democracy, and insist on promoting democracy and enhancing unity.\nSince the new era, General Secretary Xi Jinping has put forward a series of new ideas, new viewpoints and new judgments on strengthening and improving the work of the CPPCC, profoundly expounded the status, role, goals, tasks, duties and missions, and practical requirements of the CPPCC, and scientifically answered a series of directional, overall, and strategic issues. It is a powerful ideological weapon to guide the work of the CPPCC in the new era. We must take Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era as the general program for overseeing the work of the CPPCC, ensure the correct political direction for the development of the CPPCC cause, and consolidate the common ideological foundation for unity and struggle. It is necessary to deeply study and implement General Secretary Xi Jinping's important ideas on strengthening and improving the work of the CPPCC, adhere to and strengthen the party's overall leadership over the work of the CPPCC, focus on the new era and new journey of the party and the state, and always plan and carry out work under the overall situation of the party and the state, and improve the level of political consultation, democratic supervision, and participation in politics.\nConsultative democracy is an important form of people's democracy in the whole process of practice. It is an important institutional design for the Party to lead the people to effectively govern the country and ensure that the people are the masters of the country. It is a unique form and unique advantage of socialist democratic politics in our country. As a basic political system in our country, the multi-party cooperation and political consultation system led by the Communist Party of China is a new type of party system that has grown out of Chinese soil. It has played a unique role in building consensus, optimizing decision-making, coordinating relations, and maintaining stability. It has great superiority and strong vitality. To adhere to and improve our country's new-type party system and promote multi-party cooperation in the new era to be more standardized, orderly, and lively, the CPPCC should create conditions for democratic parties and people without party affiliation to play a better role in the CPPCC. In consultation, the CPPCC promotes broad unity, promotes multi-party cooperation, and practices people's democracy, fully reflecting the characteristics and advantages of China's socialist democracy. It is necessary to give full play to the role of the special consultative body of the CPPCC, and integrate consultative democracy throughout the whole process of performing its functions. The CPPCC should give full play to its united front organizational function, adhere to great unity and great alliance, adhere to consistency and diversity unity, continuously consolidate the common ideological and political foundation, strengthen ideological and political leadership, widely build consensus, strive to seek the greatest common divisor, draw the greatest concentric circle, and gather the majestic power to achieve national rejuvenation.\nTo seek common ground in business, and to achieve success through cooperation. Striving forward on a new journey full of glory and dreams, the CPPCC has a glorious mission and great responsibility. Unite more closely around the CPC Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping as the core, fully implement Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era, deeply understand the decisive significance of the \"Two Establishments\", strengthen the \"Four Consciousness\", strengthen the \"Four Confidence\", achieve the \"Two Maintenance\", work together with one heart and one mind, work together, strengthen confidence and move forward with courage, and we will surely make new and greater contributions to the Chinese path to modernization to comprehensively promote the construction of a strong country and the great cause of national rejuvenation."

GONZALEZ, Bankruptcy Judge.\n\nBefore the Court are cross-motions for summary judgment separately brought by Michael Jordan (“Jordan”) and WorldCom, Inc. (hereafter referred to as the “Debtors” or “MCI”).\n\nOn or about July 10, 1995, Jordan and the Debtors entered into an endorsement agreement (the “Agreement”). At that time, Jordan was considered to be one of the most popular athletes in the world. The Agreement granted MCI a ten-year license to use Jordan’s name, likeness, “other attributes,” and personal services to advertise and promote MCI’s telecommunications products and services beginning in September 1995 and ending in August 2005. The Agreement did not prevent Jordan from endorsing most other products or services, although he could not endorse the same products or services that MCI produced. In addition to a $5 million signing bonus, the Agreement provided an annual base compensation of $2 million for Jordan. The Agreement provided that Jordan would be treated as an independent contractor and that MCI would not withhold any amount from Jordan’s compensation for tax purposes. The Agreement provided that Jordan was to make himself available for four days, not to exceed four hours per day, during each contract year to produce television commercials and print advertising and for promotional appearances. The parties agreed that the advertising and promotional materials would be submitted to Jordan for his approval, which could not be unreasonably withheld, fourteen days prior to their release to the general public. From 1995 to 2000, Jordan appeared in several television commercials and a large number of print ads for MCI.\n\nOn July 1, 2002, MCI commenced a case under chapter 11 of title 11 of the United States Code (the “Bankruptcy Code”) in the Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York. On January 16, 2003, Jordan filed Claim No. 11414 in the amount of $2 million plus contingent and unliquidated amounts allegedly due under the Agreement. On July 18, 2003, the Debtors rejected the Agreement as of that date, pursuant to § 365(a) of the Bankruptcy Code. Following that rejection of the Agreement, Jordan filed Claim No. 36077 (the “Claim”) in the amount of $8 million — seeking $2 million for each of the payments that were due in June of 2002, 2003, 2004, and 2005. MCI does not object to the Claim to the extent Jordan seeks $4 million for the 2002 and 2003 payments under the Agreement. As of the rejection in July 2003, two years remained under the Agreement.\n\nMCI asserts [as one of two bases, the other being omitted here, ed.] for disallowance of the Claim … that Jordan had an obligation to mitigate his damages and failed to do so. MCI argues that … [it is entitled] to summary judgment with respect to its objection to the claim, and assert[s] that … the Claim should be reduced to $4 million. MCI argues that it is under no obligation to pay Jordan for contract years 2004 and 2005.\n\nJordan argues for summary judgment allowing the Claim in full and overruling and dismissing MCI’s objections to the Claim. … Regarding MCI’s mitigation argument, Jordan argues that the objection should be overruled and dismissed for three independent reasons (1) Jordan was a “lost volume seller” and thus mitigation does not apply, (2) there is no evidence that Jordan could have entered into a “substantially similar” endorsement agreement, and (3) Jordan acted reasonably when he decided not to pursue other endorsements after MCI’s rejection of the Agreement.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\n… C. Mitigation\n\nThe doctrine of avoidable consequences, which has also been referred to as the duty to mitigate damages, “bars recovery for losses suffered by a non-breaching party that could have been avoided by reasonable effort and without risk of substantial loss or injury.” Edward M. Crough, Inc. v. Dep’t of Gen. Servs. Of D.C., 572 A.2d 457, 466 (D.C. 1990). The burden of proving that the damages could have been avoided or mitigated rests with the party that committed the breach. See Norris v. Green, 656 A.2d 282, 287 (D.C. 1995) (“The failure to mitigate damages is an affirmative defense and the [breaching party] has the burden of showing the absence of reasonable efforts to mitigate”). The efforts to avoid or mitigate the damages do not have to be successful, as long as they are reasonable.\n\nJordan argues that as a “lost volume seller” he was under no obligation to mitigate damages. MCI counters that Jordan is not a lost volume seller and that MCI has shown that Jordan failed to take reasonable steps to mitigate damages.\n\n1. Whether Jordan Was a “Lost Volume Seller”\n\nJordan argues that MCI’s mitigation defense does not apply here because Jordan is akin to a “lost volume seller.” Jordan points to testimony demonstrating that he could have entered into additional endorsement contracts even if MCI had not rejected the Agreement. Thus, he argues, any additional endorsement contracts would not have been substitutes for the Agreement and would not have mitigated the damages for which MCI is liable.\n\n“A lost volume seller is one who has the capacity to perform the contract that was breached\n\nin addition to other potential contracts due to unlimited resources or production capacity.”\n\nPrecision Pine & Timber, Inc. v. United States, 72 Fed. Cl. 460, 490 (Fed.Cl. 2006). A lost volume seller does not minimize its damages by entering into another contract because it would have had the benefit of both contracts even if the first were not breached. See Jetz Servs. Co.\n\nv. Salina Props., 865 P.2d 1051, 1055-56 (Kan.Ct.App. 1993). The lost volume seller has two expectations, the profit from the breached contract and the profit from one or more other contracts that it could have performed at the same time as the breached contract. See Snyderv. Herbert Greenbaum & Assocs., 380 A.2d 618, 624 (Md. Ct. Spec. App. 1977). “The philosophical heart of the lost volume theory is that the seller would have generated a second sale irrespective of the buyer’s breach” and that “[i]t follows that the lost volume seller cannot possibly mitigate damages.” D. Matthews, Should the Doctrine of Lost Volume Seller Be Retained? A Response to Professor Breen, 51 U. MIAMI L. REV. 1195, 1214 (July 1997).\n\nThe lost volume seller theory is recognized in the Restatement (2d) of Contracts, §§ 347, 350 (1981) (the “Restatement (2d)”). The lost volume seller theory applies to contracts for services as well as goods. See Restatement (2d), § 347, ill. 16; see also Jetz Servs., 865 P.2d at 1055-56(applying theory to seller of services); Gianetti v. Norwalk Hosp., 779 A.2d 847, 853 (Conn.App.Ct. 2001) (applying theory to provider of medical services).\n\nThis case offers a twist on the typical lost volume seller situation. In what the Court regards as the typical situation, the non-breaching seller has a near-inexhaustible supply of inventory. See, e.g., Katz Commc’ns, Inc. v. Evening News Ass’n, 705 F.2d 20, 26 (2d Cir. 1983). In the typical situation, when a buyer breaches an agreement to buy a good or service from the seller, the item is returned to inventory and the lost volume seller continues in its efforts to sell its goods or services. However, the transactions that occur following the breach are not necessarily the result of the breach but fundamentally the result of the seller continuing efforts to market its goods and services. It is this continuous effort coupled with a virtually limitless supply that warrants the lost volume exception to mitigation. As stated above, the transactions that may occur after the breach would in the context of the lost volume seller have occurred independent of the breach. Here, Jordan lacked a nearly limitless supply and had no intention of continuing to market his services as a product endorser.\n\nAlthough not addressed by a D.C. court, the majority of cases hold that Jordan bears the burden of proving that he is a lost volume seller. [citations] To claim lost volume seller status, Jordan must establish that he would have had the benefit of both the original and subsequent contracts if MCI had not rejected the Agreement. See Ullman-Briggs, 754 F. Supp. at 1008. Although there is no definitive set of elements that the non-breaching party must show, many\n\ncases seem to follow the language from the Restatement (2d), Section 347, that the non-breaching party must show that it “could and would have entered into” a subsequent agreement. See, e.g., Donald Rubin, Inc. v. Schwartz, 191 A.D.2d 171, 172 (1st Dep’t 1993); Precision Pine, 72 Fed. Cl. at 496-97; Gianetti, 833 A.2d at 897; Jetz Servs., 865 P.2d at 1056; see also Green Tree Financial, 2002 WL 3116072, at *9 (“[t]o recover lost profits under this theory, a non-breaching party must prove three things: (1) that the seller of services had the capability to perform both contracts simultaneously; (2) that the second contract would have been profitable; and (3) that the seller of service would have entered into the second contract if the first contract had not been terminated”).\n\nIn his arguments, Jordan focuses primarily on his capacity to enter subsequent agreements, arguing that the loss of MCI’s sixteen-hour annual time commitment hardly affected his ability to perform additional endorsement services. On this prong alone, Jordan likely would be considered a lost volume seller of endorsement services because he had sufficient time to do multiple endorsements. Although he does not have the “infinite capacity” that some cases discuss, a services provider does not need unlimited capacity but must have the requisite capacity and intent to perform under multiple contracts at the same time. See Gianetti, 266 Conn. at 561-62 (plastic surgeon could be considered a lost volume seller if it were determined that he had the capacity and intent to simultaneously work out of three or four hospitals profitably).\n\nContrary to Jordan’s analysis, courts do not focus solely on the seller’s capacity. The seller claiming lost volume status must also demonstrate that it would have entered into subsequent transactions. See Diasonics, 826 F.2d at 684; Green Tree Financial, 2002 WL 31163072, at *9; Gianetti, 779 A.2d at 853 (“for sellers of personal services to come within the purview of the Restatement’s lost volume seller theory…, they must establish,” in addition to capacity, that additional sales would have been profitable and that they would made the additional sale regardless of the buyer’s breach). Jordan has not shown he could and would have entered into a subsequent agreement. Rather, the evidence shows that Jordan did not have the “subjective intent” to take on additional endorsements. See Ullman-Briggs, 754 F. Supp. at 1008. The testimony from Jordan’s representatives establishes that although Jordan’s popularity enabled him to obtain additional product endorsements in 2003, Jordan desired to scale back his level of endorsements. Jordan’s financial and business advisor, Curtis Polk (“Polk”), testified that at the time the Agreement was rejected, Jordan’s desire was “not to expand his spokesperson or pitchman efforts with new relationships.” See Debtors’ Mot. Summ. J., App. 5, at 32. Polk testified that had Jordan wanted to do additional endorsements after the 2003 rejection, he\n\ncould have obtained additional deals. See id. at 64-65. Jordan’s agent, David Falk (“Falk”),testified that “there might have been twenty more companies that in theory might have wanted to sign him” but that Jordan and his representatives wanted to avoid diluting his image. See Debtors’ Mot. Summ J., App. 6, at 24. Jordan’s Memorandum for Summary Judgment stated that at the time the Agreement was rejected, Jordan had implemented a strategy of not accepting new endorsements because of a belief that new deals would jeopardize his ability to achieve his primary goal of National Basketball Association (“NBA”) franchise ownership. …\n\nOne of the classic examples of the lost volume seller is found in Neri v. Retail Marine Corp., 30 N.Y.2d 393, 399-400 (N.Y. 1972) [:]\n\n[I]f a private party agrees to sell his automobile to a buyer for $2,000, a breach by the buyer would cause the seller no loss (except incidental damages, i.e., expense of a new sale) if the seller was able to sell the automobile to another buyer for\n\n$2,000. But the situation is different with dealers having an unlimited supply or standard-priced goods. Thus, if an automobile dealer agrees to sell a car to a buyer at the standard price of $2,000, a breach by the buyer injures the dealer, even though he is able to sell the automobile to another for $2,000. If the dealer has an inexhaustible supply of cars, the resale to replace the breaching buyer costs the dealer a sale, because, had the breaching buyer performed, the dealer would have made two sales instead of one. The buyer’s breach, in such a case, depletes the dealer’s sales to the extent of one, and the measure of damages should be the dealer’s profit on one sale.\n\nThis example would surely have a different result if the car dealership was winding down its business and had agreed to sell one of its last cars to a buyer. If that buyer subsequently breached the contract and did not purchase the car, the dealership could hardly be expected to recover lost profits damages if the dealer put the car back onto a deserted car lot, made no attempts to sell it, and kept the dealership shuttered to new customers. Those modifications are analogous to Jordan’s situation, with his stated desire to withdraw his services from the endorsement marketplace, and the lost volume seller theory accordingly does not apply to his circumstances.\n\nJordan states that it is a “red herring” to speculate under the lost volume analysis on what he would have done because that\n\nignores the central point of the lost volume principle: if Jordan had . . . accepted a substantially similar endorsement opportunity — exactly what [MCI] argues he was required to do to mitigate damages — the damages for which [MCI] is liable\n\nwould not have been reduced by one penny because the lost volume principle would allow Jordan to retain the benefits of both the [MCI] Agreement and the hypothetical additional endorsement.\n\nJordan overlooks an important point about the lost volume seller theory — that the “original sale and the second sale are independent events,” Snyder, 380 A.2d at 625, because the lost volume seller’s intent to enter into new contracts is the same before and after a purchaser’s breach. The lost volume seller’s desire to sell more units of goods or services is virtually unaffected by the loss of a single sale or agreement.\n\nNext, even if Jordan had mitigated damages by entering one subsequent endorsement agreement, this, without more, does not mean that Jordan was a lost volume seller. The lost volume seller has the intent and capacity to sell multiple units despite the breach of a contract for one transaction.\n\nFinally, if Jordan had entered into a subsequent agreement or agreements, and if he had showed both the capacity and the intent to make subsequent sales, that might have had the effect of helping him to establish his status as a lost volume seller, which generally would relieve him of the duty to mitigate. This would not be a novel situation but it ignores the fact that he did not do so. See, e.g., … Chicago Title Ins. Corp. v. Magnuson, 2005 WL 2373430, at *23 (S.D. Ohio Sept. 26, 2005) (when there is no evidence in the record that plaintiff “turned away or would have turned away business during the relevant period” and the “only evidence on the issue supports that the [plaintiff] could and would have completed such transactions,” the consequent instructions to the jury that the plaintiff was a lost volume seller and therefore had no duty to mitigate its damages were not erroneous).\n\nBecause the evidence establishes, among other things, that Jordan would not have entered into subsequent agreements, Jordan has not established that he is a lost volume seller. This theory thus does not relieve Jordan from the duty to mitigate damages.\n\n2. Whether Jordan Made Reasonable Efforts to Mitigate\n\nJordan argues at length that MCI must show that Jordan could have entered a “substantially similar” endorsement contract in order to mitigate damages. However, this is not the law of the mitigation of damages or the avoidable consequences theory. This language stems from federal employment cases concerning back pay and mitigation, which this case, while similar in many respects, is not. See, e.g., Ford Motor Co. v E.E.O.C., 458 U.S. 219, 231-32 (1982) (the duty to mitigate damages, “rooted in an ancient principle of law, requires the claimant to use reasonable diligence in finding other suitable employment. Although the . . . claimant need not go into another line of work, accept a demotion, or take a demeaning position, he forfeits his\n\nright to back pay if he refuses a job substantially equivalent to the one he was denied”).\n\nSeveral of the justifications for the “substantially similar or equivalent” standard of employment law, aside from the general remedial policy of making the non-breaching party whole for losses caused by the breaching party, show why there is less concern here regarding a “substantially equivalent” opportunity as Jordan was not an employee of MCI. For one, the standard exists in part to ensure the employee’s future advancement by mandating that the employee’s promotional opportunities and status should be virtually identical to the prior position. Since Jordan was never an employee of MCI, this is not relevant. Second, to require acceptance of inferior employment can mean “that one who has been discriminated against would be obliged, in order to mitigate damages, to submit to the very discrimination of which he complains. This, obviously, has no application here. Finally, the employee’s duty to make reasonable efforts in finding substantially equivalent employment is “based both on the doctrine of mitigation of damages and on the policy of promoting production and employment.” See N.L.R.B. v. Miami Coca-Cola Bottling Co., 360 F.2d 569, 575 (5th Cir. 1966). …\n\nMore accurately, MCI must show the absence of reasonable efforts by Jordan to avoid consequences or minimize his damages. See … Joseph M. Perillo, Calamari & Perillo on Contracts, § 14.15, at 584 (5th Ed. 2003) (“The doctrine of avoidable consequences merely requires reasonable efforts to mitigate damages”). … MCI carries its burden by showing that Jordan has not taken affirmative steps to mitigate damages. Jordan admits in his brief that at the time of the rejection of the Agreement, “Jordan had already implemented a business strategy of not accepting new endorsements.” … Based on the foregoing, and drawing all permissible factual inferences in favor of Jordan, the Court determines that MCI has established that Jordan did not take affirmative steps to mitigate damages. …\n\n3. Whether Jordan’s Beliefs that Another Endorsement Would Dilute His Impact as an Endorser or Harm His Reputation\n\nWere Reasonable Justifications for not Mitigating Damages\n\nJordan cites the risk that entering another endorsement contract could dilute his impact as an endorser or damage his reputation or business interests. … MCI convincingly responds that adding an agreement to replace a lost one is merely maintaining the status quo, not a dilution of Jordan’s impact by addition. … While the Court recognizes that Jordan’s image is the true commodity here and its market value could be diluted from overexposure, MCI has shown that Jordan’s image was not at risk of dilution by replacing the MCI endorsement agreement with another one. …\n\nUnder the risk to reputation theory Jordan cites, an injured party is not allowed to recover\n\nfrom a wrongdoer those damages that the injured party “could have avoided without undue risk, burden or humiliation.” See Restatement (2d), § 350(1). Jordan’s “harm to reputation” argument is flawed because the envisioned harm to Jordan’s reputation does not rise to the level of harm found in the cited case law. The cases cited by Jordan illustrate the harm to reputation that will excuse a party’s duty to mitigate. In Eastman Kodak Co. v. Westway Motor Freight, Inc., 949 F.2d 317 (10th Cir. 1991), Kodak shipped a load of sensitized photographic material on a truck operated by the defendant. Most of the material was destroyed in transit because of the defendant’s mishandling. The Tenth Circuit held that Kodak was not required to sell the damaged merchandise to mitigate damages, stating that the record revealed that Kodak’s reputation, which it spent considerable resources in developing, “could be harmed if it was required to sell damaged merchandise in order to mitigate damages.” Id. at 320. …\n\n4. Whether Focusing on NBA Ownership Was a Reasonable Decision\n\n[Cited] Cases demonstrate that a court will not sharply second-guess the decisions made by a non-breaching party when it attempts to mitigate the damages caused by the breaching party. The cases differ from Jordan’s situation because his decision to focus on NBA team ownership was independent of MCI’s rejection and was not contemplated as one that would lessen the harm of that rejection. Such a decision was unrelated to the duty to mitigate damages resulting from a rejected agreement as a product endorser. In short, the argument that Jordan acted reasonably by focusing solely on his efforts to become an NBA team owner is a red herring. It may have been reasonable for Jordan to focus on becoming an NBA team owner in the scope of Jordan’s overall future desires but that does not mean it can support a determination that he was relieved of his obligation to mitigate damages in response to MCI’s rejection of the Agreement. …\n\nCONCLUSION\n\n… The Court finds that [as a matter of law] Jordan failed to mitigate damages but a further evidentiary hearing is necessary to determine what Jordan could have received had he made reasonable efforts to mitigate, a determination that consequently will affect the Claim.\n\nThe Debtors are to settle an order consistent with this opinion.\n\nLegal case analysis\n\nThis article consists of two cases, please read carefully to understand the course of the case and the reasons for the court's decision.\n\n\n\nThe first case:Allegheny College v. The National Chautauqua County Bank\n\nCourt of Appeals of New York (1927) 246 N.Y. 369, 159 N.E. 173\n\nOpinion by: CARDOZO\n\nThe plaintiff, Allegheny College, is an institution of liberal learning at Meadville, Pennsylvania. In June 1921, a “drive” was in progress to secure for it an additional endowment of $1,250,000. [You can see a photo of Allegheny College at the end of the case.] An appeal to contribute to this fund was made to Mary Yates Johnston of Jamestown, New York. In\n\nresponse thereto, she signed and delivered on June 15, 1921, the following writing:\n\nEstate Pledge,\n\nAllegheny College Second Century Endowment\n\nJamestown, N. Y., June 15, 1921.\n\nIn consideration of my interest in Christian Education, and in consideration of others subscribing, I hereby subscribe and will pay to the order of the Treasurer of Allegheny College, Meadville, Pennsylvania, the sum of Five Thousand Dollars;\n\n$5,000.\n\nThis obligation shall become due thirty days after my death, and I hereby instruct my Executor, or Administrator, to pay the same out of my estate. This pledge shall bear interest at the rate of . . . . per cent per annum, payable annually, from till paid.\n\nThe proceeds of this obligation shall be added to the Endowment of said Institution,\n\nor expended in accordance with instructions on reverse side of this pledge.\n\nName MARY YATES JOHNSTON,\n\nAddress 306 East 6th Street, Jamestown, N. Y.\n\nDayton E. McClain Witness\n\nR. Courtis Witness \n\nto authentic signature.\n\n\n\nOn the reverse side of the writing is the following indorsement:\n\nIn loving memory this gift shall be known as the Mary Yates Johnston Memorial Fund, the proceeds from which shall be used to educate students preparing for the Ministry, either in the United States or in the Foreign Field.\n\nThis pledge shall be valid only on the condition that the provisions of my Will, now extant, shall be first met.\n\n\n\nMARY YATES JOHNSTON.\n\nThe subscription was not payable by its terms until thirty days after the death of the promisor. The sum of $1,000 was paid, however, upon account in December, 1923, while the promisor was alive. The college set the money aside to be held as a scholarship fund for the benefit of students preparing for the ministry. Later, in July, 1924, the promisor gave notice to the college that she repudiated the promise. Upon the expiration of thirty days following her death, this action was brought against the executor of her will to recover the unpaid balance.\n\nThe law of charitable subscriptions has been a prolific source of controversy in this State and elsewhere. We have held that a promise of that order is unenforcible like any other if made without consideration (Hamilton College v. Stewart, 1 N. Y. 581; Presb. Church v. Cooper, 112 N. Y. 517; 23rd St. Bap. Church v. Cornell, 117 N. Y. 601). On the other hand, though professing to apply to such subscriptions the general law of contract, we have found consideration present where the general law of contract, at least as then declared, would have said that it was absent (Barnes v. Perine, 12 N. Y. 18; Presb. Soc. v. Beach, 74 N. Y. 72; Keuka College v. Ray, 167 N. Y. 96; cf. Eastern States League v. Vail, 97 Vt. 495, 508, and cases cited; Y. M. C. A. v. Estill, 140 Ga. 291; Amherest Academy v. Cowls, 6 Pick. 427; Ladies Collegiate Inst. v. French, 16 Gray, 196; Martin v. Meles, 179 Mass. 114; Robinson v. Nutt,185 Mass. 345; U. of Pa. v. Coxe, 277 Penn. St. 512; Williston, Contracts, § 116).\n\nA classic form of statement identifies consideration with detriment to the promisee sustained by virtue of the promise (Hamer v. Sidway, 124 N. Y. 538; Anson, Contracts [Corbin’s ed.], p. 116; 8 Holdsworth, History of English Law, 10). So compendious a formula is little more than a half truth. There is need of many a supplementary gloss before the outline can be so filled in as to depict the classic doctrine. “The promise and the consideration must purport to be the motive each for the other, in whole or at least in part. It is not enough that the promise induces the detriment or that the detriment induces the promise if the other half is wanting” (Wisc. & Mich. Ry. Co. v. Powers, 191 U.S. 379, 386; McGovern v. City of N. Y., 234 N. Y. 377, 389; Walton Water Co. v. Village of Walton, 238 N. Y. 46, 51; 1 Williston, Contracts, § 139; Langdell, Summary of the Law of Contracts, pp. 82-88). If A promises B to make him a gift, consideration may be lacking, though B has renounced other opportunities for betterment in the faith that the promise will be kept.\n\nThe half truths of one generation tend at times to perpetuate themselves in the law as the whole truths of another, when constant repetition brings it about that qualifications, taken once for granted, are disregarded or forgotten. The doctrine of consideration has not escaped the common lot. As far back as 1881, Judge Holmes in his lectures on the Common Law (p. 292), separated the detriment which is merely a consequence of the promise from the detriment which is in truth the motive or inducement, and yet added that the courts “have gone far in obliterating this distinction.” The tendency toward effacement has not lessened with the years. On the contrary, there has grown up of recent days a doctrine that a substitute for consideration or an exception to its ordinary requirements can be found in what is styled “a promissory estoppel” (Williston, Contracts, §§ 139, 116). Whether the exception has made its way in this State to such an extent as to permit us to say that the general law of consideration has been modified accordingly, we do not now attempt to say. Cases such as Siegel v. Spear & Co. (234N. Y. 479) and DeCicco v. Schweizer (221 N. Y. 431) may be signposts on the road. Certain, at least, it is that we have adopted the doctrine of promissory estoppel as the equivalent of consideration in connection with our law of charitable subscriptions. So long as those decisions stand, the question is not merely whether the enforcement of a charitable subscription can be squared with the doctrine of consideration in all its ancient rigor. The question may also be whether it can be squared with the doctrine of consideration as qualified by the doctrine of promissory estoppel.\n\n\n\nWe have said that the cases in this State have recognized this exception, if exception it is thought to be. Thus, in Barnes v. Perine (12 N. Y. 18) the subscription was made without request, express or implied, that the church do anything on the faith of it. Later, the church did incur expense to the knowledge of the promisor, and in the reasonable belief that the promise would be kept. We held the promise binding, though consideration there was none except upon the theory of a promissory estoppel. In Presbyterian Society v. Beach (74 N. Y. 72) a situation substantially the same became the basis for a like ruling. So in Roberts v. Cobb (103 N. Y. 600) and Keuka College v. Ray (167 N. Y. 96) the moulds of consideration as fixed by the old doctrine were subjected to a like expansion. Very likely, conceptions of public policy have shaped, more or less subconsciously, the rulings thus made. Judges have been affected by the thought that “defences of that character” are “breaches of faith toward the public, and especially toward those engaged in the same enterprise, and an unwarrantable disappointment of the reasonable expectations of those interested” (W. F. Allen, J., in Barnes v. Perine, supra, page 24; and cf. Eastern States League v. Vail, 97 Vt. 495, 505, and cases there cited). The result speaks for itself irrespective of the motive. Decisions which have stood so long, and which are supported by so many considerations of public policy and reason, will not be overruled to save the symmetry of a concept which itself came into our law, not so much from any reasoned conviction of its justice, as from historical accidents of practice and procedure (8 Holdsworth, History of English Law, 7 et seq.). The concept survives as one of the distinctive features of our legal system. We have no thought to suggest that it is obsolete or on the way to be abandoned. As in the case of other concepts, however, the pressure of exceptions has led to irregularities of form.\n\nIt is in this background of precedent that we are to view the problem now before us. The background helps to an understanding of the implications inherent in subscription and acceptance. This is so though we may find in the end that without recourse to the innovation of promissory estoppel the transaction can be fitted within the mould of consideration as established by tradition.\n\nThe promisor wished to have a memorial to perpetuate her name. She imposed a condition that the “gift” should “be known as the Mary Yates Johnston Memorial Fund.” The moment that the college accepted $1,000 as a payment on account, there was an assumption of a duty to do whatever acts were customary or reasonably necessary to maintain the memorial fairly and justly in the spirit of its creation. The college could not accept the money, and hold itself free thereafter from personal responsibility to give effect to the condition (Dinan v. Coneys, 143 N. Y. 544, 547; Brown v. Knapp, 79 N. Y. 136; Gridley v. Gridley, 24 N. Y. 130; Grossman v. Schenker, 206 N. Y. 466, 469; 1 Williston, Contracts, §§ 90, 370). More is involved in the receipt of such a fund than a mere acceptance of money to be held to a corporate use (cf. Martin v. Meles, 179 Mass. 114, citing Johnson v. Otterbein University, 41 Ohio St. 527, 531, and Presb. Church v. Cooper, 112 N. Y. 517). The purpose of the founder would be unfairly thwarted or at least inadequately served if the college failed to communicate to the world, or in any event to applicants for the scholarship, the title of the memorial. By implication it undertook, when it accepted a portion of the “gift,” that in its circulars of information and in other customary ways, when making announcement of this scholarship, it would couple with the announcement the name of the donor. The donor was not at liberty to gain the benefit of such an undertaking upon the payment of a part and disappoint the expectation that there would be payment of the residue. If the college had stated after receiving $1,000 upon account of the subscription that it would apply the money to the prescribed use, but that in its circulars of information and when responding to prospective applicants it would deal with the fund as an anonymous donation, there is little doubt that the subscriber would have been at liberty to treat this statement as the repudiation of a duty impliedly assumed, a repudiation justifying a refusal to make payments in the future. Obligation in such circumstances is correlative and mutual. A case much in point is N. J. Hospital v. Wright (95 N. J. L. 462, 464), where a subscription for the maintenance of a bed in a hospital was held to be enforcible by virtue of an implied promise by the hospital that the bed should be maintained in the name of the subscriber (cf. Bd. of Foreign Missions v. Smith, 209 Penn. St. 361). A parallel situation might arise upon the endowment of a chair or a fellowship in a university by the aid of annual payments with the condition that it should commemorate the name of the founder or that of a member of his family. The university would fail to live up to the fair meaning of its promise if it were to publish in its circulars of information and elsewhere the existence of a chair or a fellowship in the prescribed subject, and omit the benefactor’s name. A duty to act in ways beneficial to the promisor and beyond the application of the fund to the mere uses of the trust would be cast upon the promisee by the acceptance of the money. We do not need to measure the extent either of benefit to the promisor or of detriment to the promisee implicit in this duty. “If a person chooses to make an extravagant promise for an inadequate consideration it is his own affair” (8 Holdsworth, History of English Law, p. 17). It was long ago said that “when a thing is to be done by the plaintiff, be it never so small, this is a sufficient consideration to ground an action” (Sturlyn v. Albany, 1587, Cro. Eliz. 67, quoted by Holdsworth, supra; cf. Walton Water Co. v. Village of Walton, 238 N. Y. 46, 51). The longing for posthumous remembrance is an emotion not so weak as to justify us in saying that its gratification is a negligible good.\n\nWe think the duty assumed by the plaintiff to perpetuate the name of the founder of the memorial is sufficient in itself to give validity to the subscription within the rules that define consideration for a promise of that order. When the promisee subjected itself to such a duty at the implied request of the promisor, the result was the creation of a bilateral agreement (Williston, Contracts, §§ 60-a, 68, 90, 370; Brown v. Knapp, supra; Grossman v. Schenker, supra; Williams College v. Danforth, 12 Pick. 541, 544; Ladies Collegiate Inst. v. French, 16 Gray, 196, 200). There was a promise on the one side and on the other a return promise, made,it is true, by implication, but expressing an obligation that had been exacted as a condition of the payment. A bilateral agreement may exist though one of the mutual promises be a promise “implied in fact,” an inference from conduct as opposed to an inference from words (Williston, Contracts, §§ 90, 22-a; Pettibone v. Moore, 75 Hun, 461, 464). We think the fair inference to be drawn from the acceptance of a payment on account of the subscription is a promise by the college to do what may be necessary on its part to make the scholarship effective. The plan conceived by the subscriber will be mutilated and distorted unless the sum to be accepted is adequate to the end in view. Moreover, the time to affix her name to the memorial will not arrive until the entire fund has been collected. The college may thus thwart the purpose of the payment on account if at liberty to reject a tender of the residue. It is no answer to say that a duty would then arise to make restitution of the money. If such a duty may be imposed, the only reason for its existence must be that there is then a failure of “consideration.” To say that there is a failure of consideration is to concede that a consideration has been promised since otherwise it could not fail. No doubt there are times and situations in which limitations laid upon a promisee in connection with the use of what is paid by a subscriber lack the quality of a consideration, and are to be classed merely as conditions (Williston, Contracts, § 112; Page, Contracts, § 523). “It is often difficult to determine whether words of condition in a promise indicate a request for consideration or state a mere condition in a gratuitous promise. An aid, though not a conclusive test in determining which construction of the promise is more reasonable is an inquiry whether the happening of the condition will be a benefit to the promisor. If so, it is a fair inference that the happening was requested as a consideration” (Williston, supra, § 112). Such must be the meaning of this transaction unless we are prepared to hold that the college may keep the payment on account, and thereafter nullify the scholarship which is to preserve the memory of the subscriber. The fair implication to be gathered from the whole transaction is assent to the condition and the assumption of a duty to go forward with performance (DeWolf Co. v. Harvey, 161 Wis. 535; Pullman Co. v. Meyer, 195 Ala. 397, 401;Braniff v. Baier, 101 Kan. 117; cf. Corbin, Offer & Acceptance, 26 Yale L. J. 169, 177, 193; McGovney, Irrevocable Offers, 27 Harv. L. R. 644; Sir Frederick Pollock, 28 L. Q. R. 100, 101). The subscriber does not say: I hand you $1,000, and you may make up your mind later, after my death, whether you will undertake to commemorate my name. What she says in effect is this: I hand you $1,000, and if you are unwilling to commemorate me, the time to speak is now.\n\nThe conclusion thus reached makes it needless to consider whether, aside from the feature of a memorial, a promissory estoppel may result from the assumption of a duty to apply the fund, so far as already paid, to special purposes not mandatory under the provisions of the college charter (the support and education of students preparing for the ministry), an assumption induced by the belief that other payments sufficient in amount to make the scholarship effective would be added to the fund thereafter upon the death of the subscriber (Ladies Collegiate Inst. v. French, 16 Gray, 196; Barnes v. Perine, 12 N. Y. 18, and cases there cited).\n\nThe judgment of the Appellate Division and that of the Trial Term should be reversed, and judgment ordered for the plaintiff as prayed for in the complaint, with costs in all courts.\n\n\n\nDissent by: KELLOGG\n\nThe Chief Judge finds in the expression “In loving memory this gift shall be known as the Mary Yates Johnston Memorial Fund” an offer on the part of Mary Yates Johnston to contract with Allegheny College. The expression makes no such appeal to me. Allegheny College was not requested to perform any act through which the sum offered might bear the title by which the offeror states that it shall be known. The sum offered was termed a “gift” by the offeror. Consequently, I can see no reason why we should strain ourselves to make it, not a gift, but a trade. Moreover, since the donor specified that the gift was made “In consideration of my interest in Christian education, and in consideration of others subscribing,” considerations not adequate in law, I can see no excuse for asserting that it was otherwise made in consideration of an act or promise on the part of the donee, constituting a sufficient quid quo pro to convert the gift into a contract obligation. To me the words used merely expressed an expectation or wish on the part of the donor and failed to exact the return of an adequate consideration. But if an offer indeed was present, then clearly it was an offer to enter into a unilateral contract. The offeror was to be bound provided the offeree performed such acts as might be necessary to make the gift offered become known under the proposed name. This is evidently the thought of the Chief Judge, for he says: “She imposed a condition that the ‘gift’ should be known as the Mary Yates Johnston Memorial Fund.” In other words, she proposed to exchange her offer of a donation in return for acts to be performed. Even so there was never any acceptance of the offer and, therefore, no contract, for the acts requested have never been performed. The gift has never been made known as demanded. Indeed, the requested acts, under the very terms of the assumed offer, could never have been performed at a time to convert the offer into a promise.\n\nThis is so for the reason that the donation was not to take effect until after the death of the donor, and by her death her offer was withdrawn. (Williston on Contracts, sec. 62.) Clearly, although a promise of the college to make the gift known, as requested, may be implied, that promise was not the acceptance of an offer which gave rise to a contract. The donor stipulated for acts, not promises. “In order to make a bargain it is necessary that the acceptor shall give in return for the offer or the promise exactly the consideration which the offeror requests. If an act is requested, that very act and no other must be given. If a promise is requested, that promise must be made absolutely and unqualifiedly.” (Williston on Contracts, sec. 73.) “It does not follow that an offer becomes a promise because it is accepted; it may be, and frequently is, conditional, and then it does not become a promise until the conditions are satisfied; and in case of offers for a consideration, the performance of the consideration is always deemed a condition.” (Langdell, Summary of the Law of Contracts, sec. 4.) It seems clear to me that there was here no offer, no acceptance of an offer, and no contract. Neither do I agree with the Chief Judge that this court “found consideration present where the general law of contract, at least as then declared, would have said that it was absent” in the cases of Barnes v. Perine (12\n\nN. Y. 18), Presbyterian Society v. Beach (74 N. Y. 72) and Keuka College v. Ray (167 N. Y. 96). In the Keuka College case an offer to contract, in consideration of the performance of certain acts by the offeree, was converted into a promise by the actual performance of those acts. This form of contract has been known to the law from time immemorial (Langdell, sec. 46) and for at least a century longer than the other type, a bilateral contract. (Williston, sec. 13.) It may be that the basis of the decisions in Barnes v. Perine and Presbyterian Society v. Beach (supra) was the same as in the Keuka College case. (See Presbyterian Church of Albany v. Cooper, 112 N. Y. 517.) However, even if the basis of the decisions be a so-called “promissory estoppel,” nevertheless they initiated no new doctrine. A so-called “promissory estoppel,” although not so termed, was held sufficient by Lord Mansfield and his fellow judges as far back as the year 1765. (Pillans v. Van Mierop, 3 Burr. 1663.) Such a doctrine may be an anomaly; it is not a novelty. Therefore, I can see no ground for the suggestion that the ancient rule which makes consideration necessary to the formation of every contract is in danger of effacement through any decisions of this court. To me that is a cause for gratulation rather than regret. However, the discussion may be beside the mark, for I do not understand that the holding about to be made in this case is other than a holding that consideration was given to convert\n\nthe offer into a promise. With that result I cannot agree and, accordingly, must dissent.\n\nJudges: Cardozo, Ch. J. Pound, Crane, Lehman and O’Brien, JJ., concur with Cardozo, Ch. J.; Kellogg, J. dissents in opinion, in which Andrews, J., concurs.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe second case:Fairmount Glass Works v. Crunden-Martin Woodenware Co.\n\nCourt of Appeals of Kentucky (1899) 106 Ky. 659, 51 S.W. 196\n\nJUDGE HOBSON.\n\nOn April 20, 1895, appellee [Crunden-Martin] wrote appellant [Fairmount Glass] following letter:\n\n“St. Louis; Mo., April 20, 1895. Gentlemen: Please advise us the lowest price you can make us on our order for ten car loads of Mason green jars, complete, with caps, packed one dozen in case, either delivered here, or f. o. b. cars your place, as you prefer. State terms and cash discount. Very truly, Crunden-Martin W. W. Co.”\n\nTo this letter appellant answered as follows:\n\n“Fairmount, Ind., April 23, 1895. Crunden-Martin Wooden Ware Co., St. Louis, Mo.—Gentlemen: Replying to your favor of April 20th, we quote you Mason fruit jars, complete, in one-dozen boxes, delivered in East St. Louis, Ill.: Pints, $4.50; quarts, $5.00; half gallons, $6.50 per gross, for immediate acceptance, and shipment not later than May 15, 1895; sixty days’ acceptance, or 2 off, cash in ten days. Yours truly, Fairmount Glass Works.\n\n“Please note that we make all quotations and contracts subject to the contingencies of agencies or transportation, delays or accidents beyond our control.”\n\nFor reply thereto, appellee sent the following telegram on April 24, 1895: “Fairmount Glass Works, Fairmount, Ind.: Your letter twenty-third received. Enter order ten car loads as per your quotation. Specifications mailed. Crunden-\n\nMartin W. W. Co.”\n\nIn response to this telegram, appellant sent the following:\n\n“Fairmount, Ind., April 24, 1895. Crunden-Martin W. W. Co., St. Louis, Mo.: Impossible to book your order. Output all sold. See letter. Fairmount Glass Works.”\n\nAppellee [Crunden-Martin] insists that, by its telegram sent in answer to the letter of April 23d, the contract was closed for the purchase of ten car loads of Mason fruit jars. [You can see a photo of the fruit jars at the end of the case.] Appellant [Fairmount Glass] insists that the contract was not closed by this telegram, and that it had the right to decline to fill the order at the time it sent its telegram of April 24th. This is the chief question in the case. The court below gave judgment in favor of appellee, and appellant has appealed, earnestly insisting that the judgment is erroneous.\n\nWe are referred to a number of authorities holding that a quotation of prices is not an offer to sell, in the sense that a completed contract will arise out of the giving of an order for merchandise in accordance with the proposed terms. There are a number of cases holding that the transaction is not completed until the order so made is accepted. Am. & Eng. Enc. Law (2d Ed.), p. 138; Smith v. Gowdy, 8 Allen, 566; Beaupre v. P. & N. A. Telegraph Co., 21 Minn.,\n\n155. But each case must turn largely upon the language there used. In this case we think there was more than a quotation of prices, although appellant’s letter uses the word “quote” in stating the prices given. The true meaning of the correspondence must be determined by reading it as a whole. Appellee’s letter of April 20th, which began the transaction, did not ask for a quotation of prices. It reads: “Please advise us the lowest price you can make us on our order for ten car loads of Mason green jars. … State terms and cash discount.” From this appellant could not fail to understand that appellee wanted to know at what price it would sell it ten car loads of these jars; so when, in answer, it wrote: “We quote you Mason fruit jars … pints $4.50, quarts $5.00, half gallons $6.50 per gross, for immediate acceptance; …2 off, cash in ten days,”—it must be deemed as intending to give appellee the information it had asked for. \n\nWe can hardly understand what was meant by the words “for immediate acceptance,” unless the latter was intended as a proposition to sell at these prices if accepted immediately. In construing every contract, the aim of the court is to arrive at the intention of the parties. In none of the cases to which we have been referred on behalf of appellant was there on the face of the correspondence any such expression of intention to make an offer to sell on the terms indicated. …\n\nIt will be observed that the telegram of acceptance refers to the specifications mailed.\n\nThese specifications were contained in the following letter: “St. Louis, Mo., April 24, 1895.\n\nFairmount Glass Works Co., Fairmount, Ind. Gentlemen:\n\nWe received your letter of 23d this morning, and telegraphed you in reply as follows: ‘Your letter 23d received. Enter order ten car loads as per your quotation. Specifications mailed,’—which we now confirm. We have accordingly entered this contract on our books for the ten cars Mason green jars, complete, with caps and rubbers, one dozen in case, delivered to us in East St. Louis, at $4.50 per gross for pint, $5.00 for quart, $6.50 for one-half gallon. Terms, sixty days’ acceptance, or 2 per cent. for cash in ten days, to be shipped not later than May 15, 1895. The jars and caps to be strictly first quality goods. You may ship the first car to us here assorted: Five gross pint, fifty-five gross quart, forty gross one-half gallon. Specifications for the remaining nine cars we will send later.\n\nCrunden-Martin W. W. Co.”\n\nIt is insisted for appellant that this was not an acceptance of the offer as made; that the stipulation, “The jars and caps to be strictly first-quality goods,” was not in their offer; and that, it not having been accepted as made, appellant is not bound. But it will be observed that appellant declined to furnish the goods before it got this letter, and in the correspondence with appellee it nowhere complained of these words as an addition to the contract. Quite a number of other letters passed, in which the refusal to deliver these goods was placed on other grounds, none of which have been sustained by the evidence. Appellee offers proof tending to show that these words, in the trade in which parties were engaged, conveyed the same meaning as the words used in appellant’s letter, and were only a different form of expressing the same idea. Appellant’s conduct would seem to confirm this evidence.\n\nAppellant also insists that the contract was indefinite, because the quantity of each size of the jars was not fixed, that ten car loads is too indefinite a specification of the quantity sold, and that appellee had no right to accept the goods to be delivered on different days.\n\nThe proof shows that “ten car loads” is an expression used in the trade as equivalent to 1,000 gross, 100 gross being regarded a car load. The offer to sell the different sizes at different prices gave the purchaser the right to name the quantity of each size, and, the offer being to ship not later than May 15th, the buyer had the right to fix the time of delivery at any time before that. … Judgment affirmed."

The role of \nForward\n01\n\n\nProgress Report of China’s National Carbon Market (2024)\nthe carbon market in promoting emission reductions across sectors has \nbeen elevated, and China’s carbon pricing mechanism, with the national \ncarbon market playing the principal role, has basically taken shape.\nThe construction and development of China’s National Carbon Market has \nattracted significant attention and widespread interest both domestically \nand internationally. The Ministry of Ecology and Environment has \norganized the compilation of this report, which aims to introduce the \nprogress and main achievements of China’s National Carbon Market \nand to share development perspectives and relevant policy design \nconsiderations, hoping to enhance domestic and international recognition \nand support. This report focuses on the construction of the National \nCarbon Emission Trading System, market operations in the second \ncompliance cycle, China Carbon Emission Allowances allocation and \nsurrender, and data quality management. This report also shares the \nprogress since the launch of the National Voluntary Greenhouse Gas \nEmission Reduction Trading Market , as well as the development of the \nnational carbon market’s infrastructure, achievements, and international \ncooperation. Additionally, the report provides an outlook on the future \ndevelopment of China’s National Carbon Market.\n02\n\n\nProgress Report of China’s National Carbon Market (2024)\nThe Chinese government attaches great importance to addressing climate \nchange and has positioned climate action as a key lever for enhancing \necological conservation and pursuing high-quality development. China \ncontinues to implement an active national strategy in response to climate \nchange, adopting a series of policies and measures to strive for carbon \nemissions peaking before 2030 and carbon neutrality before 2060 (hereinafter \nthe “dual carbon” goals). Among these measures, the carbon market serves \nas an essential policy tool for China to promote cost-effective carbon \nemissions reduction across sectors and to achieve the “dual carbon” goals. It \nalso plays a fundamental role in China’s carbon pricing mechanism.\nThe influence of China’s National Carbon Market \ncontinues to expand\nChina’s National Carbon Emission Trading System covers the \nlargest amount of greenhouse gas emissions globally\nIn accordance with the decisions and plans of the CPC Central \nCommittee and the State Council, and drawing experience from \ninternational carbon markets and practices of domestic pilot markets, the \nNational Carbon Emission Trading System (hereinafter the “National \nETS”) started trading in July 2021. Beginning with the power sector, \nit now includes 2,257 key emitting entities, covering about 5.1 billion \ntonnes of annual carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions—more than 40 percent \nof China’s total CO2 emissions, making it the world’s largest market in \nterms of the amount of greenhouse gas emissions covered.\nAbstract\n03\n\n\nProgress Report of China’s National Carbon Market (2024)\nCompliance and voluntary markets form China’s National Carbon \nMarket, harnessing policy synergy\nIn January 2024, the National Voluntary Greenhouse Gas Emission \nReduction Trading Market (hereinafter the “National Voluntary Market”) \nwas officially launched, another policy tool for accomplishing the “dual \ncarbon” goals, following the launch of the National ETS. The compliance \nmarket strictly controls carbon emissions of key emitting entities, while the \nNational Voluntary Market encourages society-wide engagement. The two \nmarkets operate independently but are interconnected through an offsetting \nmechanism for China Carbon Emission Allowances (hereinafter “CEAs”) \n \nsurrendering. Together, they form China’s National Carbon Market.\nChina’s National Carbon Market has contributed an innovative \n“Chinese approach” to the global carbon market\nChina’s National Carbon Market significantly impacts global carbon \nprices and the effectiveness of carbon trading mechanisms around \nthe world; its development and operation have drawn substantial \ninternational attention. The National ETS, with its intensity-control \nobjectives, demonstrates the flexibility and applicability of the carbon \nmarket-based mechanism. The National ETS has contributed an \ninnovative “Chinese approach” to the global carbon market mechanism.\nConstruction of China’s National Carbon Market \nprogressed significantly\nThe Interim Regulations for the Management of Carbon Emission \nTrading has been released and come into force and the fundamental \nregulatory framework has been established\n04\n\n\nProgress Report of China’s National Carbon Market (2024)\nIn January 2024, the State Council issued the Interim Regulations for \nthe Management of Carbon Emission Trading, which is China’s first \nspecialized legislation in the field of climate change. It was taken into \neffect on May 1, 2024, forming the National ETS’s fundamental policy \nand regulatory framework along with the ministerial measures, normative \ndocuments, and technical standards. Ecology and environment authorities \nand other relevant government agencies at each level, key emitting \nentities, registries, trading institutions, and technical service institutions \nhave assumed their respective responsibilities to ensure the smooth \noperation across all aspects of the National ETS, including emission data \naccounting, reporting and verification, CEAs allocation and surrendering, \nand trading and market supervision.\nSuccessful conclusion of the second compliance cycle of the National \nETS and a steady increase in market vibrancy\nThe supply and demand of CEAs in the second compliance cycle for the \nNational ETS was generally balanced, aligning with policy expectations. \nBy the end of 2023, the compliance rate for 2021 and 2022 were 99.61 \npercent and 99.88 percent, respectively, an improvement compared \nto the first compliance cycle and ranking among the top international \ncarbon markets. From January 1, 2022 to December 31, 2023, the trading \nvolume of CEAs was 263 million tonnes, with a transaction value of \n17.26 billion yuan. The scale of trade expanded, and CEAs price showed \na steady rise, with the number of key emitting entities participating in \ntrading up by 31.79 percent compared to the first compliance cycle. The \nflexible compliance mechanisms helped 202 key emitting entities facing \ndifficulties fulfill their compliance obligation.\n05\n\n\nProgress Report of China’s National Carbon Market (2024)\nEmission data quality has been comprehensively improved and digital \ninfrastructure provides solid support to the national carbon market\nThe Chinese government attaches great importance to and continues \nto strengthen data quality management and optimize accounting and \nverification methods, keeping monthly records on key emissions data \nand implementing a three-tier joint review system of emission data at \nnational, provincial, and municipal levels. Intelligent early warning \nsystems utilizing information technology tools like big data were \nadopted, along with supervision and support in key areas. A closed-\nloop management mechanism of “timely detect- transfer to relevant \ndepartments for handling and supervision - check and rectification” to \naddress issues was established, assuring data quality and meeting the \ndata needs of the smooth and orderly operation of the National ETS. The \nNational Carbon Trading Market Management Platform, registration \nsystem, trading system, and other infrastructures operated safely and \nstably, achieving interconnection and communication among various \nsystems. This led to online management of all processes, data centralized \nthroughout entire procedures, and comprehensive decision-making \non a scientific basis, significantly enhancing data quality management \ncapabilities of carbon emissions.\nEffectiveness of China’s National Carbon Market \ndevelopment gradually increases \nEnterprises’ carbon emission management capabilities have been \nstrengthened and the effectiveness of emission reduction of sectors \nwas enhanced\n06\n\n\nProgress Report of China’s National Carbon Market (2024)\nChina’s National Carbon Market has ensured that enterprises fully \nassume their responsibilities to abate carbon emissions, raising society-\nwide low-carbon awareness that “emissions come at a cost and reductions \nyield benefits.” Most key emitting entities conducted methods to measure \nvalues of elemental carbon content. By offering enterprises flexibility \nto curtail emissions, the carbon market’s guiding role in greenhouse gas \nreduction and facilitating energy mix adjustment has become gradually \nevident. In 2023, the emission intensity of national thermal power \ngeneration (CO2 emissions per unit of electricity by thermal power \ngeneration) decreased by 2.38 percent compared to 2018, while the \nemission intensity of electricity generation (CO2 emissions per unit of \nelectricity generation) decreased by 8.78 percent compared to 2018. \nFundamental role of carbon pricing mechanism has begun to take \neffect, promoting high-quality green and low-carbon development\nOn April 24, 2024, the closing price of the National ETS exceeded 100 \nyuan per tonne for the first time. The green finance attributes of CEAs are \ngaining recognition from an increasing number of financial institutions, \nwith CEAs prices being seen as an anchor for climate investment \nand financing, carbon asset management, and allowance pledging. \nThis encouraged green and low-carbon investment led to notable \nimprovements in energy efficiency within the thermal power generation \nsector, facilitating energy mix adjustment and promoting high-quality \ngreen and low-carbon development.\nCarbon emission statistics and accounting systems have been \nconsolidated and the technical service system and market have \nbegun to take shape\n07\n\n\nProgress Report of China’s National Carbon Market (2024)\nEfforts have been made to establish a carbon emission statistics and \naccounting institutional system for key sectors that suits China’s national \ncircumstances, providing essential data support for formulating and \nreleasing the annual CO2 emissions factor for electricity generation, \nthe regional power grid baseline emission factor, and establishing and \nimproving the carbon footprint management system. A large number \nof professionals and relevant entities have been cultivated through \nstrengthening institutional management, clarifying responsibilities \nand liabilities, optimizing technical specifications, and enhancing \nsupervision and inspection. This has laid a solid foundation for achieving \nthe “dual carbon” goals. In 2023, over 50 consulting firms, more than \n450 inspection and testing institutions, and nearly 100 verification \nagencies provided third-party technical services to key emitting entities \nand government regulatory authorities. Provincial ecological and \nenvironmental authorities evaluated the services provided by technical \nverification agencies. Among the 16,611 evaluations rating the timeliness \nand quality of work, 99.7 percent were rated as qualified.\nLooking ahead, the Chinese government will continue to enhance \n \nChina's National Carbon Market and to deepen international exchange \nand cooperation in the carbon market, accelerate the process of \ndeveloping a more effective, vibrant, and internationally influential \ncarbon market, and strive to make greater contributions to addressing \nglobal climate change.\n08\n\n\nProgress Report of China’s National Carbon Market (2024)\nThe Chinese government attaches great importance to addressing \nclimate change, viewing it as a crucial lever for enhancing ecological \nconservation and achieving high-quality development. The government \ncontinues to implement a national strategy to combat climate change, \nadopting a series of policies and measures to achieve the “dual carbon” \ngoals. China's National Carbon Market is an essential institutional \narrangement that utilizes market mechanisms to control greenhouse gas \nemissions. It is an important policy tool to achieve the “dual carbon” \ngoals and plays a fundamental role in carbon pricing.\nPresident Xi Jinping emphasized the establishment of China's National \nCarbon Market as a key measure to address climate change at the Paris \nConference on Climate Change. The “1+N” policy documents for \ncarbon peaking and carbon neutrality, including the Working Guidance \nfor Carbon Dioxide Peaking and Carbon Neutrality in Full and Faithful \nImplementation of the New Development Philosophy and the Action \nPlan for Carbon Dioxide Peaking Before 2030, position the National \nETS as an essential policy tool for achieving the “dual carbon” goals. \nThe report to the 20\nth CPC National Congress proposed to improve the \nI. The Chinese government attaches great \nimportance to the development of \nChina's National Carbon Market \n09\n\n\nProgress Report of China’s National Carbon Market (2024)\ncarbon emissions trading system.\nSince 2023, requirements on China’s National Carbon Market \ndevelopment have been further clarified in relevant major conferences \nand policy documents. The National Conference on Ecological and \nEnvironmental Protection proposed building a more effective, vibrant, \nand internationally influential carbon market. The Opinions of the \nCPC Central Committee and the State Council on Comprehensively \nAdvancing the Building of a Beautiful China made overall plans for \nand demanded further progress of China’s National Carbon Market, \nwhich includes the steady expansion of sector coverage, the enrichment \nof trading product varieties and methods, and the setting up and \nimprovement of the National Voluntary Market. China’s 2024 Report \non the Work of the Government listed expanding sectorial coverage of \nthe National ETS as a government task of the year.\nThe innovative development of China’s National Carbon Market is \nencouraging market entities to innovate green and low-carbon technologies \nwith higher efficiency and lower cost, providing inexhaustible impetus for \nthe development of new quality productive forces.\n10\n\n\nProgress Report of China’s National Carbon Market (2024)\nAfter three years of development and operation, the institutional \nframework of the National ETS has been basically established, its legal \nbasis has been strengthened, and supporting technical standards have \ncontinued to be refined, laying a solid foundation for the stable and \norderly operation of the market.\ni.Release and implementation of the Interim Regulations for the \nManagement of Carbon Emission Trading\nOn January 25, 2024, the State Council promulgated the Interim \nRegulations for the Management of Carbon Emission Trading (hereinafter \nreferred to as “the Regulations”), which came into effect on May 1, \n2024. The Regulations is China’s first specialized legislation in the field \nof addressing climate change, clarifying the primary aspects of carbon \nemissions trading market activities and the legal responsibilities of entities \ninvolved. The Regulations strengthens legal supervision and management \nand introduced severe penalties for violations (as shown in Figure 1). This \nunderscores the legal principle of using the strictest systems and most \nrigorous rules of law to protect the ecological environment, marking it a \nII. The institution of the National Carbon \nEmission Trading System is gradually \nimproving\n11\n\n\nProgress Report of China’s National Carbon Market (2024)\nsignificant milestone. The issuing of the Regulations demonstrated China’s \nresolve and confidence in actively addressing climate change and its sense \nof duty as a responsible major country.\n12\nFigure 1. Framework for the Interim Regulations for the Management of Carbon Emission Trading\n\n\nProgress Report of China’s National Carbon Market (2024)\nColumn 1: the Interim Regulations for the Management \nof Carbon Emission Trading\nThe Regulations, for the first time in the form of administrative regulation, clearly \ndefines carbon emissions trading-related activities. It stipulated key management \ntasks for authorities of ecology and environment at national and local levels, \nincluding identifying key emitting entities, submitting emission data and verifying \nannual reports, CEAs allocating and surrendering, and market trading. The \nRegulations clarifies the roles of key emitting entities, registration institution, \ntrading institution, and third-party technical service entities in supporting and \nensuring market operations. It also specifies penalties for behaviors such as \nfailure to surrender CEAs in full and on time and emission data fraud, thereby \nsolidifying the legal foundation for the healthy development of the National ETS.\nThe Regulations adheres to a problem-oriented approach, follows the general \nprinciples of strengthening full process management, maintaining appropriate \nflexibility, and severely punishing illegal and non-compliant activities, and \nthereby building a fundamental institutional framework for carbon emissions \ntrading management. First, the coverage of the Regulations leaves no blind \nspots. The Regulations clearly define the main components of carbon emissions \ntrading and all types of participating entities and specifying legal responsibilities \nfor illegal and non-compliant activities. Second, key components are targeted \nprecisely. Specific requirements and penalties have been developed for key \nmanagement aspects of the National ETS, such as emission data accounting, \nreporting and verification, CEAs surrender, and market trading. Penalties are \nintensified for serious violations to serve as an effective legal deterrent. Third, \npenalty measures are diverse. The Regulations stipulates various administrative \npenalties for illegal and non-compliant activities, including fines, confiscation of \nunlawful gains, orders to suspend production, prohibition from engaging in the \nbusiness, and revocation of certifications.\nii.Completion of the fundamental policy and regulatory framework \nfor the National ETS\nThe Ministry of Ecology and Environment has issued the Measures for \nthe Administration of Carbon Emissions Trading (Trial) and released \nthree rules for registration, trading, and settlement. The Ministry has \n13\n\n\nProgress Report of China’s National Carbon Market (2024)\nFigure 2. Policies and regulatory framework for the National ETS\nalso formulated and revised normative documents such as guidelines for \nemission accounting, reporting and verification, and CEAs allocation \nplans. Together with the Regulations, these efforts formed a multi-level \nsystem encompassing “administrative regulations + ministerial measures + \nnormative documents + technical standards” (as shown in Figure 2).\nIn August 2023, the Supreme People’s Court and the Supreme People’s \nProcuratorate revised and issued the Interpretation on Several Issues \nConcerning the Application of Law in Handling Criminal Cases of \nEnvironmental Pollution. This interpretation includes the falsification \nof carbon emission data by third-party technical service entities, such \nas emission verification agencies, consulting agencies, and inspection \nagencies, within the scope of criminal jurisdiction. It clarifies sentencing \nstandards and serves as a deterrent of the criminal justice system.\n14\n\n\nProgress Report of China’s National Carbon Market (2024)\niii.Improved operational mechanism of the National ETS\nThe National ETS has formed a comprehensive system architecture, \nincluding emission data accounting, reporting and verification, CEAs \nallocation and surrendering, market trading, and supervision (as \nshown in Figure 3). Competent government authorities are responsible \nfor making CEAs allocation plans and issuing annual CEAs to key \nemitting entities. Key emitting entities are required to measure and \nreport their emission data from the previous year on an annual basis, \nwhich is then verified by competent government authorities. Key \nemitting entities are required to surrender CEAs equivalent to their \nemissions to fulfill their compliance obligation before the deadline. \nThe National ETS offers flexibility for key emitting entities to meet \ntheir emission mitigation responsibilities through CEAs trading. \nTo ensure its effective operation, the Ministry of Ecology and \nEnvironment has developed various information systems, including \na market management platform, a registration system, and a trading \nsystem for the National ETS. The National Carbon Trading Market \nManagement Platform records emission-related data of key emitting \nentities. The national carbon emissions registration system documents \ninformation on the holding, changes, surrendering, and cancellation \nof CEAs and provides settlement services. The national carbon \nemissions trading system ensures the centralized and unified trading \nof CEAs within National ETS.\n15\n\n\nProgress Report of China’s National Carbon Market (2024)\nFigure 3. Architecture of the National ETS\n16\n\n\nProgress Report of China’s National Carbon Market (2024)\nThe second compliance cycle (2021-2022) of the National ETS included \n2,257 key emitting entities in the power generation sector (including \ncaptive power plants in other sectors), covering annual greenhouse gas \nemissions of approximately 5.1 billion tonnes of CO2 equivalent, making \nit the largest emission market in the world.\nBy the end of 2023, the cumulative trading volume of CEAs in the \nNational ETS reached 442 million tonnes, with a cumulative transaction \nvalue of 24.92 billion yuan (shown in Figure 4). During the second \ncompliance cycle, the cumulative trading volume of CEAs was 263 \nmillion tonnes, with a cumulative turnover of 17.26 billion yuan. The \ntrading scale has gradually expanded, with trading prices showing steady \ngrowth and participants becoming more active.\ni.Scaling up trading\nDuring the second compliance cycle of the National ETS, the cumulative \ntrading volume and value of CEAs increased by 47.01 percent and \n125.26 percent, respectively, compared to the first compliance cycle. The \ntransaction volume of listed and bulk agreement trading increased by \n33.93 percent and 49.73 percent, respectively. In July 2023, the Ministry \nof Ecology and Environment released a notice on CEAs surrender \nIII. Increased market vibrancy of the \nNational Carbon Emission Trading System\n17\n\n\nProgress Report of China’s National Carbon Market (2024)\nfor 2021 and 2022. Various regions in China organized key emitting \nentities to develop trading plans as early as possible. The trading volume \ncontinued to rise from August to October in 2023. The average monthly \ntrading volume in the first half of 2024 reached 3.67 million tonnes, a \nyear-on-year increase of 174.9 percent.\nii.Steady rise in trading prices \nDuring the second compliance cycle of the National ETS, the composite \nprice for market closing fluctuated between 50 and 82 yuan/tonne. By \nthe end of 2023, the composite price for market closing was 79.42 yuan/\ntonne, an increase of 65.46 percent compared to the opening price on \nthe first trading day and 46.48 percent higher than the closing price of \nthe first compliance cycle. With the Regulations released and coming \ninto full force as well as the continuous advancement of work related \nto the third compliance cycle, the market trading price has shown a \nsteady upward trend. The composite price for market closing exceeded \n100 yuan/tonne for the first time on April 24, 2024. It is a concrete \nmanifestation of the market’s role in resource distribution for carbon \nemission reduction, which gave further impetus to enterprises to pursue \ngreen and low-carbon transition.\niii.Increasingly active trading participants \nIn the second compliance cycle of the National ETS, transactions occur \nevery trading day, with key emitting entities showing enthusiasm for \nengaging in market activities. Compared to the first compliance cycle, \nan additional 338 entities opened trading accounts from 2022 to 2023, \nthe number of key emitting entities participating in trading increased \nby 31.79 percent, and the number of key emitting entities with multiple \n18\n\n\nProgress Report of China’s National Carbon Market (2024)\ntransactions increased by 32.14 percent. The number of key emission \nentities with trading volume exceeding a million tonnes increased by \n77.59 percent, while the number of key emission entities using both \nlisting and bulk agreements trading rose by 36.87 percent. Key emitting \nentities have made trading plans as early as possible based on their own \nsituations. The month with peak trading volume shifted from December \nto October, with a notable increase in active trading days\n①. After the end \nof the second compliance cycle, the average monthly trading volume \nand the average number of key emitting entities participated in the first \nhalf of 2024 increased by 49.54 percent and 90.79 percent, respectively, \ncompared to the same period in 2022. \nFigure 4. Transactions and prices during the first and second compliance cycles of \nthe National ETS\n①   Active trading days refer to the number of trading days where the daily trading volume exceeds the \naverage level for that year.\n19\n\n\nProgress Report of China’s National Carbon Market (2024)\nCEAs allocation and surrender are essential for the healthy, stable, \nand orderly operation of the National ETS and for achieving policy \nobjectives. Based on national greenhouse gas emission control targets, \nthe National ETS currently adopts an intensity-based benchmarking \nmethod for CEAs allocation. This approach aligns with the pace and \nefforts to achieve China’s “dual carbon” goals. \ni.Supply and demand of CEAs generally balanced\nThe National ETS issued 5.096 billion tonnes and 5.104 billion tonnes \nof CEAs  for 2021 and 2022, respectively. The verified emissions (CEAs \nobligated to surrender) were 5.094 billion tonnes and 5.091 billion \ntonnes, resulting in surpluses of 1.47 million tonnes and 12.98 million \ntonnes. This represented 0.03 percent and 0.25 percent of the total CEAs \nallocated, respectively. The balance between the supply and demand of \nCEAs has been maintained for the second compliance cycle, meeting \npolicy expectations. Meanwhile, key emitting entities used a total of 3.72 \nmillion tonnes of national certified voluntary emission reduction to offset \ntheir CEAs surrendering obligation.\nIV. Completion of CEAs allocation  \nand surrender in the second  \ncompliance cycle \n20\n\n\nProgress Report of China’s National Carbon Market (2024)\nii.CEAs allocation plan further optimized\nCompared to the first compliance cycle, CEAs allocation methods for \n2021 and 2022 maintained policy continuity and stability in general \nwhile being optimized based on the circumstances of the power \ngeneration sector. First, different CEAs allocation benchmark values \nwere adopted for 2021 and 2022, with the second year’s benchmark \nvalues determined based on the previous year’s actual emissions, making \nthe benchmark value more aligned with sector realities. Second, a \nbalance value was introduced for the first time as an important reference \nfor setting electricity-generated and heat-generated benchmarks, \neffectively addressing significant deviations in determining benchmark \nvalues. Third, electricity-generated and heat-generated benchmarks for \nvarious types of generators were enhanced to reflect the sector emission. \nIt reflects a policy orientation that incentivizes efficient and clean \ngenerators while constraining inefficient ones.\niii.CEAs surrender management mechanism established\nFirst, a dynamic monitoring mechanism for compliance risks was \ndeveloped. Timely assessment of the compliance risks of key emitting \nentities were carried out and relevant information was regularly notified \nto, enabling automatic early warning of compliance risks. Second, \ntargeted assistance programs were initiated. Local ecological and \nenvironmental authorities comprehensively reviewed enterprises’ \nCEAs surplus and shortfall situations. They visited enterprises with \ncompliance difficulties, pushing them to develop compliance plans \nearly, and providing targeted assistance. Third, flexible compliance \nmechanisms were created. To alleviate pandemic-related impacts \n21\n\n\nProgress Report of China’s National Carbon Market (2024)\non some enterprises’ CEAs surrendering, key emitting entities with \nhigh CEAs deficits were allowed to borrow CEAs, and tailored relief \nmechanisms were introduced for key emitting entities undertaking major \npublic welfare tasks. The flexible compliance mechanisms helped 202 \nkey emitting entities facing difficulties fulfill their compliance obligation.\nBy the end of 2023, the compliance rates for 2021 and 2022 were 99.61 \npercent and 99.88 percent, respectively, showing an improvement \ncompared to the first compliance cycle and ranking China among the top \ninternational carbon markets. A total of 80 key emitting entities failed to \ncomply fully and on time, which is 98 fewer than in the first compliance \ncycle. Local ecology and environment departments have handled these \nnon-compliant entities in accordance with relevant regulations.\n22\n\n\nProgress Report of China’s National Carbon Market (2024)\nThe Chinese government attached great importance to and \ncontinuously strengthened the data quality management of the \nNational ETS. It has established a set of emission accounting, \nreporting, and verification systems with Chinese characteristics that \nhave proven to be effective. The basic capacity of power generation \nenterprises in carbon emission data statistics and accounting have \nbeen significantly enhanced. The standardization, accuracy, and \ntimeliness of carbon emission reports have markedly improved, \nmeeting the data needs for the sound and orderly operation of the \nNational ETS.\ni.Scientific accounting, reporting, and verification rules \nTo address challenges faced by key emitting entities in submitting \nsamples for coal quality analysis and conducting on-site verifications \ndue to the pandemic, adjustments were made to the methods for \nobtaining data for months with missing coal quality reports. Emission \ndata accounting formulas were optimized, reducing the number of \nformulas for measuring power generation sectors from 27 to 12 \nand replacing parameters that require complex calculations such as \nV. Improvement in emission\ndata quality \n23\n\n\nProgress Report of China’s National Carbon Market (2024)\n“amount of electricity supply” and “heat-supply ratio” with directly \nmeasurable data such as “amount of electricity generation” and \n“amount of heat generation.” Key emitting entities are required to \ndevelop and strictly implement data quality control plans, clearly \nspecifying provisions for key parameters in carbon emission \naccounting, measuring equipment, and handling of missing data, \nstandardizing internal management systems for data quality, and \nstrengthening key emitting entities’ carbon emission accounting \ncapabilities. China also started to explore the application of the \ncontinuous emission monitoring system (CEMS) for CO2 emissions. \nSince 2021, carbon emission monitoring and assessment pilots \nhave been conducted in key sectors such as thermal power, iron and \nsteel, and cement. As of March 2024, CEMS equipment has been \ninstalled at 152 spots in 72 enterprises. Research is being carried \nout on equipment selection, monitoring spot selection, comparison \nand analysis of accounting and monitoring data, and evaluation of \nautomatic monitoring results. Specialized verification guidelines for \nthe power generation sector have been released to address issues such \nas inconsistent detail and inaccurate key components in verification \nreports. These guidelines developed standardized procedures and \nmandatory verification requirements, proposing “check, inquire, \nobserve, and verify” methods for 18 key parameters, thereby ensuring \nconsistent verification criteria and boundaries.\n24\n\n\nProgress Report of China’s National Carbon Market (2024)\nColumn 2: Carbon emission reporting and \nverification in 2023\nIn 2023, Competent deparments of ecology and environment at provincial \nlevel organized 92 verification agencies and 2,702 staff members to review \nthe 2022 carbon emission reports for the power generation sector. Some \nregions explored innovative supervision methods by introducing certification \nexams for verification personnel, ensuring they are qualified to conduct \ntheir tasks. Several regions carried out random inspections to supervise the \nreview process and evaluate the capabilities of the verification personnel. \nIn collaboration with market regulatory authorities, some areas re-tested \ncoal samples retained from key emitting entities to ensure the credibility \nof the inspection and report results. Evaluations indicated that verification \npersonnel have gained a deeper understanding of technical specifications, \nleading to more standardized review processes and consistent technical \nassessments. The quality of verification work has significantly improved, \nwith non-compliance issues identified by verification agencies decreasing \nby approximately 35.7 percent compared to 2022. The rate of first-time \nrectification for non-compliance issues reached about 92 percent, a notable \nimprovement from the previous year.\nii.Implementation of a three-tier joint review and monthly \nrecorded data \nA three-tier joint review system at the national, provincial, and municipal \nlevels has been established for the monthly recorded data of key emitting \nentities. Key emitting entities are required to submit key parameters \nand supporting materials for emission accounting through the National \nCarbon Trading Market Management Platform on a monthly basis. \nCompetent departments of ecology and environment at National, \nprovincial, and municipal levels conduct regular reviews. Using big data \n25\n\n\nProgress Report of China’s National Carbon Market (2024)\ntechnology, abnormal data is promptly identified and early warnings \nare issued. This has enabled comprehensive, full-process, and routine \nsupervision over the registry of key emitting entities, the compilation \nand implementation of data quality control plans, monthly recorded \ndata, emission reporting, and verification. Identified issues are promptly \ntransferred to local authorities for verification, ensuring that key emitting \nentities implement necessary corrections. Since March 2023, the on-\ntime submission rate of monthly recorded data by key emitting entities \nhas consistently remained at 100 percent, with the number of problems \nsignificantly reduced and effectively resolved.\niii.Specialized supervision and support on emission data reporting quality \nSince 2021, the Ministry of Ecology and Environment organized \nthree rounds of supervision and assistance campaigns to enhance the \nquality of emission reporting for key emitting entities. Experts and law \nenforcement specialists were dispatched across the country to conduct \non-site supervision of about 538 key emitting entities distributed \nacross 25 provinces and 73 cities for identified issues, clear criteria \nwere established, along with standards for case closure and itemized \nlists for supervision and rectification. Additionally, follow-ups on the \nrectifications from the first compliance cycle were continually conducted. \nA total of 54 administrative penalties were imposed across various \nregions for data quality issues, with a total market value of penalties and \ncanceled CEAs equivalent to 1.4 billion yuan.\niv.Strengthening management capabilities \nIn 2023, competent departments of ecology and environment at \n26\n\n\nProgress Report of China’s National Carbon Market (2024)\nvarious levels held 134 training sessions regarding the development \nof the National ETS. These sessions attracted approximately 11,600 \nparticipants. The Ministry of Ecology and Environment organized six \nsessions specifically targeting data quality management. Attendees \nincluded representatives from competent departments of ecology and \nenvironment at the provincial and municipal levels, key emitting entities, \nand verification institutions. Forty training videos were produced through \nthe National Carbon Trading Market Management Platform and online \ntraining that reached more than 10,000 participants were held. An expert \npanel for China’s national carbon emissions trading market was formed, \nwhich has provided timely responses to address 688 technical and policy \nquestions encountered by participating entities.\n27\n\n\nProgress Report of China’s National Carbon Market (2024)\nTo mobilize society-wide participation in greenhouse gas emission \nreduction, the National Voluntary Market was officially launched on \nJanuary 22, 2024. The market is led by the government and emphasizing \nthe voluntary nature and the role of the market, in line with international \npractice. It strengthens information disclosure and public oversight, \nupholds market integrity, equity, and transparency, and contributes to \nachieving the “dual carbon” goals.\ni.Developing the fundamental institutional framework \nIn 2023, the Ministry of Ecology and Environment and the State \nAdministration for Market Regulation jointly released the Measures \nfor the Administration of Voluntary Greenhouse Gas Emission \nReduction Trading (Trial). This established the overall approach, work \nprocesses, and rights and responsibilities of market participants in the \nNational Voluntary Market (as shown in Figure 5). It requires project \nowners and third-party validation and verification bodies to make dual \ncommitments regarding the authenticity and compliance of voluntary \nemission reduction projects and their emission reductions.

The National Center \nfor Climate Change Strategy and International Cooperation (National \nVoluntary Greenhouse Gas Emission Reduction Registration Institution) \nreleased the Rules for Voluntary Greenhouse Gas Emission Reduction \nRegistration (Trial) and the Guidelines for Voluntary Greenhouse Gas \nEmission Reduction Project Design and Implementation. The China \nBeijing Green Exchange (National Voluntary Greenhouse Gas Emission \nReduction Trading Institution) formulated and issued the Rules for \nVoluntary Greenhouse Gas Emission Reduction Trading and Settlement \n(Trial). These relevant policies, regulations, and technical specifications \nprovide comprehensive guidance on all processes and elements for \nparticipating entities. \nFigure 5. Design and implementation process of the National Voluntary Market\n29\n\n\nProgress Report of China’s National Carbon Market (2024)\nii.Release of the first batch of project methodologies \nIn March 2023, the Ministry of Ecology and Environment publicly \nsolicited voluntary greenhouse gas emission reduction project \nmethodologies, receiving a total of 361 submissions. After scientific \nevaluation and selection, based on principles such as high social \nexpectation, clear emission reduction mechanisms, guaranteed data \nquality, combined social and ecological benefits, and ensuring effective \nsupervision, the first batch of four methodologies was released. These \nColumn 3: General criteria for voluntary greenhouse \ngas emission reduction projects and emission reductions\nVoluntary greenhouse gas emission reduction projects and emission \nreductions must meet general criteria, including authenticity, additionality, \nuniqueness, and conservativeness. Authenticity means certified voluntary \nemission reductions must be genuine, accurate, and reliable. Additionality \nrefers to voluntary emission reduction projects that should help overcome \nbarriers related to internal rate of return, financing, and critical technologies. \nThe project’s greenhouse gas emissions should be lower than the baseline \nemissions, or its greenhouse gas removals should be higher than the baseline \nremovals. Uniqueness means the project must not participate in other \ngreenhouse gas emission reduction trading mechanisms; there should be no \ninstances of project duplication or double-counting of emission reductions. \nConservativeness refers to the practice of using conservative methods \nfor estimation and value assessment when precise judgments for relevant \nparameters or technical pathways are difficult during the accounting or \nverification process of voluntary greenhouse gas emission reduction projects. \nThis ensures that project emission reductions are not overestimated.\n30\n\n\nProgress Report of China’s National Carbon Market (2024)\nmethodologies include forestation carbon sequestration, grid-connected \nsolar thermal power generation, grid-connected offshore wind power \ngeneration, and mangrove afforestation, supporting the development of \nforestry carbon sequestration and renewable energy projects.\niii.Innovative projects and management methods on emission \nreduction data quality\nTo guarantee authentic, long-lasting, and additional emission reduction \neffects and strengthen data quality management, the Ministry of Ecology \nand Environment considered potential risks for voluntary emission \nreduction projects in various fields. Key technical components for project \nvalidation and emission reduction verification were added to the project \nmethodologies, strengthening targeted data quality management for \nproject owners and validation and verification bodies. On this basis, the \nfeasibility of online management of measurement data is being explored. \nBy utilizing information technology tools, real-time data verification can \nbe achieved, ensuring the quality of projects and emission reductions \nfrom the data source.\n31\n\n\nProgress Report of China’s National Carbon Market (2024)\nThe National Carbon Trading Market Management Platform, registration \nsystem, trading system, and other infrastructure operate safely and stably, \nachieving interconnection among various systems, which contributed \nto the integrated management of all business processes, centralized data \ncollection throughout the entire process, and a comprehensive scientific \ndecision-making process. \ni.Establishment of National Carbon Trading Market Management \nPlatform \nThe National Carbon Trading Market Management Platform is an \nintegrated management system that serves the full process of carbon \nemission data management, quality supervision, and verification \nmanagement. In February 2023, the platform was officially launched \nto adopt information technology tools such as big data to enable \nautomatic detection and verification of abnormal emissions data and \nrelated parameters and provide early warning for suspicious data, \nwhich digitized and optimized key aspects of carbon emission data \nmanagement. Users include regulatory authorities, key emitting entities, \ntechnical service institutions, and other stakeholders. It has enriched \nVII. Robust digital infrastructure for \nChina’s National Carbon Market \n32\n\n\nProgress Report of China’s National Carbon Market (2024)\nthe technical methods of data quality management and significantly \nimproved efficiency. A National Carbon Trading Market Information \nNetwork website and a social media account have been launched to \nrelease authoritative information on China's National Carbon Market. To \ndate, the social media account has over 7,000 followers, and the website \nand social media account have received 70,000 visits.\nii.Optimization of the national carbon emission registration system \nand trading system \nThe national carbon emission registration system and trading system are \nundergoing constant optimization and upgrading, with strengthened daily \noperation and maintenance management. Daily collaboration mechanisms \nhave been established within competent departments of ecological and \nenvironmental at the provincial level to secure smooth CEAs allocation, \ntrading, surrendering, and offsetting. During the second compliance \ncycle, the national carbon emission registration system supported the \nissuance and surrendering of over 10 billion tonnes of CEAs. System \nfunctions such as compliance completion certificates and compliance risk \nearly warnings were developed and launched, achieving unified serial \nnumber management of CEAs. The National ETS successfully labeled \nCEAs for 2021 and 2022 and price information for the national carbon \nemission trading market, sending a unified price signal. The two systems \nhave provided over 200,000 services to 2,257 key emitting entities and \nother market participants.\niii.Launch of the national voluntary greenhouse gas emission \nreduction registration system and trading system \n33\n\n\nProgress Report of China’s National Carbon Market (2024)\nThe national voluntary greenhouse gas emission reduction registration \nsystem and trading system are crucial infrastructures for the National \nVoluntary Market. Currently, the development of these systems have \nbeen launched for business operation, with 4,582 accounts. The \nregistration system provides registration and cancellation services for \nvoluntary emission reduction projects and emission reductions, while \nthe trading system offers centralized and unified trading and settlement \nservices for certified voluntary emission reductions to market entities. \nMeanwhile, the two systems align with widely accepted international \nstandards, to achieve unique serial numbers for certified voluntary \nemission reductions.\n34\n\n\nProgress Report of China’s National Carbon Market (2024)\ni.Enterprises’ carbon emission management capabilities have been \neffectively strengthened \nChina’s national carbon market has ensured that enterprises fully assume \ntheir responsibilities to abate carbon emissions, raising society-wide low-\ncarbon awareness that “emissions come at a cost and reductions yield \nbenefits.” Key emitting entities in the power generation sector have \nestablished internal control systems for carbon emission management, \nwith over 80 percent assigning dedicated personnel for carbon assets \nmanagement and incorporating it into daily operation activities. The \nmajority of key emitting entities have assessed their emission reduction \npotential and costs, actively adopting emission mitigation measures such \nas low-carbon technology retrofits and production process optimization \nand implementing emissions reduction as internal assessments. Most \nkey emitting entities use measuring methods to get values of elemental \ncarbon content.\nii.Enhanced effectiveness of sector emission reduction \nCompared to setting mandatory restrictions on production and emission, \nthe carbon emission trading mechanism distributes resources for carbon \nVIII. Growing effectiveness of China’s \nNational Carbon Market development \n35\n\n\nProgress Report of China’s National Carbon Market (2024)\nemission reduction through market means, providing enterprises \nflexibility on emission mitigation and driving sector emission reduction. \nUnder the premise of ensuring the rapid development of the power \n \nsector and energy security, in 2023, the emission intensity of national \nthermal power generation (CO2 emissions per unit of electricity by \nthermal power generation) decreased by 2.38 percent compared to 2018, \nwhile the emission intensity of electricity generation (CO2 emissions \nper unit of electricity generation) decreased by 8.78 percent compared \nto 2018. The carbon market’s guiding role in promoting greenhouse gas \nreduction, facilitating energy mix adjustment, as well as encouraging the \nefficient and restraining the inefficient has become more evident. \niii.Fundamental role of carbon pricing mechanism has begun to \ntake effect\nOn April 24, 2024, the closing price of the National ETS exceeded 100 \nyuan per tonne for the first time. The green finance attributes of CEAs are \ngradually gaining recognition from the market, with market prices being \nseen as an anchor for climate investment and financing, carbon assets \nmanagement, and CEAs pledging. This encouraged green and low-carbon \ninvestment and led to notable improvements in energy efficiency within \nthe thermal power generation sector, facilitating energy mix adjustment, \nand promoting high-quality green and low-carbon development.\niv.Consolidated carbon emission statistics and accounting \nPursuant to China’s national circumstance, a comprehensive, scientific, \neffective, and internationally aligned carbon emission data statistics, \naccounting and management system has been established, through \n36\n\n\nProgress Report of China’s National Carbon Market (2024)\nbuilding a long-term supervision mechanism and cracking down on \nfraudulent practices strictly. Monthly data and updates at the installations \nand enterprise level have covered over 40 percent of China’s national \nCO2 emissions. The standardization, accuracy, and timeliness of carbon \nemission statistics and accounting have been improved. The measured \ndata of key parameters such as fossil fuels provide basic data support for \nthe scientific formulation and release of  the annual CO2 emission factors \nfor electricity generation, regional power grid baseline emission factors, \nand establishing and improving carbon footprint management systems. \nA large number of professionals and relevant entities in carbon reduction \nand carbon management have been cultivated, laying a solid foundation \nfor achieving the “dual carbon” goals. \nv.The technical service system and market have begun to take shape \nA large number of qualified technical institutions have been cultivated \nby strengthening institutional management, clarifying responsibilities \nand liabilities, optimizing technical specifications, and enhancing \nsupervision and inspection. In 2023, over 50 consulting firms provided \nannual emission report formalization for key emitting entities, more \nthan 450 inspection and testing institutions conducted routine reviews \non fuel usage by key emitting entities, and nearly 100 verification \nagencies engaged in the technical verification of annual emission reports \nsubmitted by key emitting entities. Competent departments of ecology \nand environment at the provincial level evaluated the services provided \nby verification agencies, with 99.7 percent of the 16,611 evaluations \nrating the timeliness and quality of work as qualified.\n37\n\n\nProgress Report of China’s National Carbon Market (2024)\nThe Chinese government upholds the United Nations Framework \nConvention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) principles of equity, \ncommon but differentiated responsibilities, and respective capabilities \nand promotes the full, balanced, and effective implementation of \nthe Paris Agreement. China actively participates in international \nnegotiations on the global carbon market mechanism under Article 6 \nof the Paris Agreement, fully respects each country’s sovereignty and \ndifferent national circumstances, and makes positive contributions to \npromoting the establishment of a scientific, fair, and reasonable global \ncarbon market mechanism.\nThe Chinese government has attached great importance to international \ncooperation in the national carbon market. Regarding the construction \nof the carbon market systems, multi-faceted exchanges, dialogues, \nand cooperation have been conducted with the EU, Germany, Norway, \nBRICS countries, and Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) partner countries. \nSuccessive China-EU ministerial dialogues on carbon emissions trading \npolicies have been held, and the China Carbon Market Conference 2023 \nwas held in Shanghai to share experience and promote mutual learning. \nIX. Strengthening international \ncooperation in carbon market \ndevelopment \n38\n\n\nProgress Report of China’s National Carbon Market (2024)\nVarious carbon market capacity-building activities have been organized \nto strengthen the foundation for carbon market implementation. China \nhas actively conducted research on key topics in the carbon market and \ncollaborated with international organizations. For example, China has \ncooperated with the World Bank on the study of monitoring, reporting, \nverification, and CEAs allocation to continuously optimize system \ndesign. International exchanges in the voluntary emission reduction \ntrading market have been enhanced to explore feasible paths for the \nNational Voluntary Market to participate in the Carbon Offsetting and \nReduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA).\nInternational attention to China’s National Carbon Market has increased \ncontinuously. With more and more global emission reduction efforts, \ncarbon markets are increasingly recognized as an essential policy tool \nfor emissions mitigation. China’s National Carbon Market covers the \nlargest amount of greenhouse gas emissions, with a significant impact \non the carbon price and effectiveness of carbon trading mechanisms \naround the world. Its establishment and operation have attracted \ngreat attention from the international community. With an intensity-\nbased objective, the National ETS enforces greenhouse gas emission \nreduction responsibilities onto enterprises and provides incentives to \ncurtail emissions. It demonstrates the flexibility and applicability of \nthe carbon market-based mechanism. China’s National Carbon Market \nhas contributed an innovative “Chinese approach” to the global carbon \nmarket mechanism.\n39\n\n\nProgress Report of China’s National Carbon Market (2024)\nChina’s economic and social development has entered a high-quality \nstage characterized by accelerated green and low-carbon development. \nAs the world’s largest developing country, China has a series of \narduous tasks ahead, including economic growth, improving people’s \nlivelihood, environmental governance, and energy security. It will \ncontinue to advance industrialization and urbanization, with its reliance \non heavy industries and a coal-dominated energy mix. In addition, \nthe time frame for reaching peak emission is tight. It will require \nextraordinary hard work to achieve the “dual carbon” goals.\nThe carbon market is an effective long-term driver to induce low-\ncarbon production and lifestyle changes across society, providing \nan efficient approach to balancing economic growth and emission \nmitigation. In the future, China’s national carbon market role as an \nessential policy tool to achieve the “dual carbon” goals and its principal \nrole in the carbon pricing mechanism will be strengthened. \nBuilding a carbon market is a complex systematic project. China’s \nNational Carbon Market is still at the initial stage and its institutional \nsystems need to be further reinforced. It still needs to be improved \nin many aspects, including the coverage of sectors, trading methods, \ntrading entities and product varieties, market vibrancy, market \nOutlook \n40\n\n\nProgress Report of China’s National Carbon Market (2024)\nfunctions, and data quality management capabilities.\nNext, China will continue to improve relevant policy-supporting \nsystems for the National ETS. While extensively considering factors \nsuch as sector carbon emissions, data quality, the synergy between \npollution reduction and carbon emission reduction, and high-quality \nsector development, China will work to increase coverage of key \nsectors through the National ETS in stages. China will gradually \nimplement a combination of free and paid CEAs allocation methods, \ngradually increasing the proportion of paid allocation to make \ncarbon prices more accurately reflect the emission reduction costs of \nenterprises. China will continuously enrich trading product varieties, \ntrading entities, and trading methods, further enhance market vibrancy, \nand improve the price discovery function. At the same time, China \nwill actively develop the National Voluntary Market with high-quality \ncarbon credits, constructing a scientific, fair, open, transparent, widely-\nparticipated system that aligns with international standards. Priority \nsupport will be given to the development of projects in ecosystem \ncarbon sequestration, renewable energy, methane emission control, \nenergy conservation, and efficiency improvement. The application \nof low-carbon, zero-carbon, and negative-carbon technologies will \nbe promoted. Efforts will be made to explore the application of \ninformation technology tools to strengthen data quality management, \nand promote the widespread application of certified voluntary emission \nreduction.\nChina will further deepen international exchange and cooperation, \nactively participate in bilateral and multilateral processes of global \n41\n\n\nProgress Report of China’s National Carbon Market (2024)\nclimate governance, and advance new progress in negotiations on \nglobal carbon market mechanisms. China will enhance cooperation \nwith relevant countries, regions, and international organizations, engage \nin policy dialogues with all parties on carbon market development, \nand strengthen research support and capacity-building cooperation. \nChina will accelerate process to build a more effective, more vibrant, \nand more internationally influential carbon market, and strive to make \ngreater contributions to addressing global climate change.\n42\n\n\nProgress Report of China’s National Carbon Market (2024)\nOn February 4, the Ministry of Ecology and Environment (MEE) \nreleased the Notice on Strengthening Management of Enterprise \nGreenhouse Gas Emissions Reporting in the Power Generation Industry \nfor 2023-2025.\nOn February 4, the National Carbon Trading Market Management \nPlatform was launched.\nOn March 13, the MEE released the Implementation Plans on National \nCarbon Emissions Trading Allowance Setting and Allocation in the \nPower Generation Industry for 2021 and 2022.\nBy March 31, key emitting entities in the power generation sector \nsubmitted the previous year’s greenhouse gas emissions report.\nFrom June 12 to June 21, the MEE conducted the second round of \nactions to supervise and support the quality improvement of carbon \nemissions reports.\nOn June 30, the competent departments of ecology and environment \nunder the provincial-level governments completed the verification tasks \nMilestones\n2023\n▶\n43\n\n\nProgress Report of China’s National Carbon Market (2024)\nfor the 2020 greenhouse gas emissions reports from key emitting entities \nin the power generation sector.\nOn July 14, the MEE released the Notice on Allowance Surrender of the \nNational Carbon Emissions Trading Market for 2021 and 2022.\nOn August 11, the National Carbon Emission Registry completed the \nallocation of the CEAs.\nOn August 28, the national carbon emissions trading system categorized \nCarbon Emission Allowance 21  and Carbon Emission Allowance 22 \nand released information on price trends for the national carbon emission \ntrading market.\nOn October 14, the MEE released the Notice on Key Industrial \nEnterprises Greenhouse Gas Emissions Reporting and Verification in 2023-\n2025, which covers sectors such as petrochemicals, chemicals, building \nmaterials, iron and steel, non-ferrous metals, paper, and civil aviation.\nOn October 19, the MEE and the State Administration for Market \nRegulation (SAMR) jointly issued the Measures for the Administration \nof Voluntary Greenhouse Gas Emission Reduction Trading (Trail).\nOn October 24, the MEE issued four methodologies of voluntary \ngreenhouse gas emission reduction projects, including forestation carbon \nsequestration, grid-connected solar thermal power generation, grid-\nconnected offshore wind power generation, and mangrove afforestation.\nOn November 8, the China Carbon Market Conference 2023 was held in \nShanghai.\nOn November 16, the National Center for Climate Change Strategy \n44\n\n\nProgress Report of China’s National Carbon Market (2024)\nand International Cooperation (National Voluntary Greenhouse Gas \nEmission Reduction Registration Institution) issued the Guidelines for \nDesign and Implementation of Voluntary Greenhouse Gas Emissions \nReduction Projects and the Registration Rules for Voluntary Greenhouse \nGas Emissions Reduction (Trial).

A good dataset is the foundation of training a good model!\n3.1: Use UVR5 to process the original audio (if the original audio is clean enough, you can skip this step, such as dry sounds extracted from games)\n3.1.1: Method 1: Use the built-in UVR5 to process audio\nClick to start UVR5-WebUI and wait a moment. The web page in Figure 2 will automatically pop up. If it does not pop up, copy http://0.0.0.0:9873 and open it in your browser.\n\nFirst, enter the audio folder path or directly select the file (choose one of the two).\nThe address box above the folder is the folder path.\n\nIf you want to copy the file path, it is like this↓\n\nFirst, process with the model_bs_roformer_ep_317_sdr_12.9755 model (which is already the best model currently) to extract the vocals, then use onnx_dereverb, and finally use DeEcho-Aggressive (to remove reverb). Choose wav as the output format. The output files will be in the GPT-SoVITS-beta\\output\\uvr5_opt folder by default. It is recommended not to change the output path, or you may not be able to find the files later. The processed audio (vocal) is the vocal, (instrument) is the accompaniment, (_vocal_main_vocal) is the one without reverb, and (others) is the one with reverb. The (vocal) (_vocal_main_vocal) are the files you need to use; you can delete the rest. After processing, remember to close UVR5 in the WebUI to save video memory.\n←Click to expand for a more detailed tutorial\nFor example, here I have prepared two pieces of material. Click on the directory, this is the path name, copy it\n\nPaste it into the input path, select the model_bs_roformer_ep_317_sdr_12.9755 model from the drop-down, and then click on Convert. Wait a moment, and the output information will display xxxx->Success\n\nYou can click on the status bar to open the bat console, where you can view the progress.\n\nThen open the output folder in the GPT-SoVITS integration package folder\n\nOpen the uvr5_opt folder\n\nThere will be twice as many files as the input files, among which the instrumental files are not needed and must be deleted, otherwise, it will affect the final result. Create a new folder and move these two files over\n\nThen change the input path to the newly created folder above, select the onnx_dereverb_By_FoxJoy model from the drop-down, and click on Convert. Then wait for a relatively long period. You can also check the progress in the bat console. If the waiting time is too long, you can skip this model; the impact is not significant. The input files are still in the uvr5_opt folder, among which others are not needed, delete them. The previous step's vocal is also not needed and can be deleted. Create a new folder and move the _vocal_main_vocal files over\n\nThen change the input path to the newly created folder above, select the VR-DeEchoAggressive model (if the reverb is heavy, select DeReverb, if it's lighter, select Normal, and if it's in between, select Aggressive), and click on Convert. Wait for a while, then open the uvr5_opt folder and delete the ones starting with instrument.\n\nIf the output is not successful and an error occurs (the current version should not report errors).\nThen it is recommended to use the following method - UVR5 client. (✅There may be compatibility issues, but the effect is aligned with UVR5, do not blindly criticize the built-in tool for having problems)\nThe reason for the error\nThe reason for the error is generally that the audio is too short, causing the audio buffer to overflow. There are also some due to insufficient graphics card performance.\n\n3.1.2: Method 2: Use the UVR5 client (no bugs, more models)\nOfficial download link: beta version\n\nofficial version\n\nCloud disk download (includes Windows and macOS): 123 Cloud Disk\n\nHow to use on macOS and Linux\nDue to Apple's strict control over application security, you may need to follow these steps to open UVR:\nFirst, use the terminal to run the following command to allow applications to run from any source:\n\nsudo spctl --master-disable\nSecondly, run the following command to bypass verification:\n\nsudo xattr -rd com.apple.quarantine /Applications/Ultimate\\ Vocal\\ Remover.app\nLinux: Well? If you're using Linux, deploying it yourself with Git should be no problem, right? Hehe~\n\nFor the best separation effect, the tutorial uses the beta version, and the Windows installation package in the cloud disk is the beta version.\nCurrently, for MAC users to use the beta version, you need to pull the code and set up the environment yourself, or wait for the installation package to be ready.\nThe installation package in the cloud disk is the official version.\nWarning: The installation path must be in English only!!! It is not recommended to change the default installation path, otherwise there will be permission issues!!!\n\nDetailed tutorial: bilibili tutorial Author@bilibili@bfloat16\nTo open UVR5, you first need to download the model. It is recommended to download the one I packaged, which includes almost all models, including VIP models. After downloading and unzipping, first delete the models folder in the Ultimate Vocal Remover root directory, and then directly drag the unzipped folder into the Ultimate Vocal Remover root directory to replace the models folder.\nModel package: 123 Cloud Disk (Just download the simplified version, it contains the models you need to use. The full version is all the models of UVR5, which may be needed in the future) Direct download from Yuque ↓\n\nIf you think the model package is too large, you can also download it yourself (you need to use a scientific method to access the Internet, and the speed is very slow, only one can be downloaded at a time). Click on the small wrench in the lower left corner to open the settings interface, and click on the third one to download the model. The required models to download are: MDX-Net: model_bs_roformer_ep_317_sdr_12.9755, VR Architecture: UVR-De-Echo-Normal, UVR-De-Echo-Aggressive, UVR-De-Echo-Dereverb, UVR-DeNoise.\nIf you are an A card or I card user, you need to check the Use OpenCL option in the second settings interface.\n\nAfter downloading the model, start processing the audio. Select input to choose the input file, select output to choose the output folder, choose WAV as the output format, and remember to check GPU Conversion (use GPU). First, select the MDX-Net type and use Bs-Roformer-Viperx-1297 (currently the best model for extracting vocals, fast and good) to extract vocals. The processed audio (vocals) is the vocal. Then input the vocal again to de-reverb (choose one of the following three): VR Architecture: UVR-De-Echo-Normal (light reverb), UVR-De-Echo-Aggressive (heavy reverb), UVR-De-Echo-Dereverb (perverted reverb), and finally use UVR-DeNoise for noise reduction. This process will be better than the built-in UVR5 in terms of vocal extraction.\n\n3.1.3: Method 3: MDX23C (temporarily used by MAC users)\nBecause there is no UVR5 beta version installation package for MAC at present, either pull the code and install it yourself, or you can only use the 5.6 official version.\nThe best model for the official version is MDX23C, and the process is the same as 4.1.1.1.3.1, just replace Bs-Roformer-Viperx-1297 with MDX23C.\n\n3.2: Audio cutting\nBefore cutting the audio, it is recommended to drag all audio into an audio software (such as au, video editing software) to adjust the volume, adjust the maximum volume to -9dB to -6dB, and delete the ones that are too high.\nFirst, enter the path of the original audio folder (no Chinese characters), if you have just gone through the UVR5 process, then it is the uvr5_opt folder. Then the parameters that can be adjusted are min_length, min_interval, and max_sil_kept, all in ms. min_length is adjusted according to the size of the video memory, the smaller the video memory, the smaller the adjustment. min_interval is adjusted according to the average interval of the audio, if the audio is too dense, it can be appropriately lowered. max_sil_kept will affect the coherence of the sentence, different audio adjustments, if you don't know how to adjust, keep the default. Other parameters are not recommended to be adjusted. Click on start voice cutting, and it will be cut immediately. The default output path is in output/slicer_opt. Of course, you can also use other cutting tools to cut.\n\nAfter cutting, the files are in output/slicer_opt. Open the cutting folder, choose size as the sorting method, and manually cut the audio longer than the video memory number of seconds to below the video memory number of seconds. For example, if the graphics card is 4090 and the video memory is 24g, then you need to manually cut the audio longer than 24 seconds to below 24 seconds, as the audio that is too long will blow up the video memory. If the voice cutting is still one file, it is because the audio is too dense. You can lower min_interval, adjust from 300 to 100, which can basically solve the problem. If it still doesn't work, manually cut with au.\n\n3.3: Audio noise reduction (if the original audio is clean enough, you can skip this step, such as dry sound extracted from the game)\nIf you think your audio is clear enough, you can skip this step, noise reduction has a great destruction to the sound quality, use it with caution.\nEnter the folder of the audio that was just cut, the default is the output/slicer_opt folder. Then click on start voice noise reduction. The default output path is in output/denoise_opt.\n\n3.4: Marking\nWhy mark: Marking is to match each audio with text, so that AI can learn how to read each word. The mark here refers to the label.\nIf you have cut or noise reduced in the previous step, the path has been automatically filled in for you. Then choose Damo ASR or fast whisper. Damo ASR can only be used to recognize Chinese and Cantonese, and the effect is the best. Fast whisper can label 99 languages, and it is currently the best English and Japanese recognition, the model size is large V3, and the language is auto automatic. Whisper can choose accuracy, it is recommended to choose float16, float16 is faster than float32, int8 speed is almost the same as float16. Then click on start offline batch ASR, the default output is the output/asr_opt path. ASR will take some time, just look at the console to see if there are any errors.\n\nIf you have subtitles, you can use subtitle marking, which is much more accurate. Embedded subtitles or external subtitles are both ok, tutorial.\n\n3.5: Proofreading marking (this step is time-consuming, if you don't pursue the ultimate effect, you can skip it)\nAfter the previous step of marking, the list path will be automatically filled in, you just need to click on start marking webui.\nAfter opening, it is SubFix, from left to right, from top to bottom, the meaning is: page number jump, save modification, merge audio, delete audio, previous page, next page, split audio, save file, reverse selection. After modifying each page, you need to click on save modification (Submit Text), if you don't save and turn the page, the text will be reset, before exiting, you need to click on save file (Save File), before any other operations, it is best to save modification (Submit Text) twice. Merge audio and split audio are not recommended, the accuracy is very poor, a lot of bugs. To delete audio, you need to click yes on the right side of the audio you want to delete, and then click delete audio (Delete Audio). After deleting, the audio in the folder will not be deleted, but the label has been deleted and will not be added to the training set. This SubFix has a lot of bugs, save more before any operation.\nTraining\n4.1: Outputting Logs\nProceed to the second page\nFirst, set the experiment name, which is essentially the model name; it can be in Chinese in theory! After tagging is completed, the path will be filled in automatically, just click on the one-click three-in-a-row.\nIf it's English, Japanese, Cantonese, or Korean, the 3-bert folder in the logs will be empty, which is normal and doesn't need to be managed.\n\n4.2: Fine-tuning Training\n\nFirst, set the batch_size. It is recommended to set the batch_size to less than half of the video memory for SoVITS training; if it's too high, it will blow up the video memory. A higher bs is not necessarily faster! The batch_size also needs to be adjusted according to the size of the dataset and is not strictly set to half of the video memory count. For example, if there is 6g of video memory, it needs to be set to 1. If the video memory explodes, adjust it lower. When the GPU 3D occupancy is 100%, it means that bs is too high, and shared video memory is being used, which will slow down the speed by several times.\n\nThe following are the maximum batch_size for SoVITS training with different video memories when the slice length is 10s. You can set it according to this. If the slice is longer and the dataset is larger, it should be appropriately reduced.\nVideo memory\tbatch_size\tSlice length\n6g\t1\t10s\n8g\t2\t10s\n12g\t5\t10s\n16g\t8\t10s\n22g\t12\t10s\n24g\t14\t10s\n32g\t18\t10s\n40g\t24\t10s\n80g\t48\t10s\n\nAfter the 0213 version, dpo training was added. Dpo greatly improves the effect of the model, almost no swallowing of words and repetition, and the number of characters that can be inferred has increased several times, but at the same time, the video memory occupancy during training has increased by more than 2 times, the training speed has slowed down by 4 times, and GPUs below 12g cannot be trained. The quality requirements of the dataset have also increased a lot. If the dataset has noise, reverb, poor sound quality, and unproofread tags, then there will be negative effects.\n\nIf your GPU is greater than 12g, and the dataset is of good quality, and you are willing to wait for a long training time, then you can enable dpo training. Otherwise, please do not enable it. The following are the maximum batch_size for GPT training with different video memories when the slice length is 10s. If the slice is longer and the dataset is larger, it should be appropriately reduced.\nVideo memory\tNo dpo batch_size\tEnabled dpo batch_size\tSlice length\n6g\t1\tTraining not possible\t10s\n8g\t2\tTraining not possible\t10s\n12g\t4\t1\t10s\n16g\t7\t1\t10s\n22g\t10\t4\t10s\n24g\t11\t6\t10s\n32g\t16\t6\t10s\n40g\t21\t8\t10s\n80g\t44\t18\t10s\n\nNext, set the number of rounds. Compared with V1, V2 has better restoration of the training set, but it is also more likely to learn the negative content in the training set. So if your materials have background noise, reverb, popping, uneven loudness, electrical noise, slobber sound, unclear speech, poor sound quality, etc., then please do not increase the number of SoVITS model rounds, otherwise, there will be negative effects. The number of GPT model rounds is generally not higher than 20, and it is recommended to set it to 10. Then, first click on SoVITS training, and after training, click on GPT training. They cannot be trained together (unless you have two cards)! If it is interrupted halfway, just click on start training again, and it will start training from the nearest save point.\n\nDuring training, please press Ctrl+Shift+Esc to open the Task Manager, scroll down and open the options, and select CUDA. If the CUDA occupancy is 0, then it is not training. The dedicated GPU memory is the video memory, and other memories are shared, not the real video memory. If the video memory explodes, lower the bs. Or there may be excessively long audio that needs to go back to step 2.2 to remake the dataset.\n\nWin11 doesn't have CUDA. Open Settings --> System --> Display --> Graphics Card --> Default Graphics Settings.\nTurn off Hardware Accelerated GPU Scheduling and restart the computer.\n\nWhen training is completed, it will display that training is completed, and the rounds displayed on the console will stop at the round of (total rounds - 1).\n\nTo check CUDA occupancy, you need to scroll down and select CUDA. If you can't find the CUDA interface on Win11, you need to turn off Hardware Accelerated GPU Scheduling and restart.\n\nRegarding learning rate weights:\nYou can lower it but it is not recommended to raise it. Listen to the comparison directly and judge the effect by yourself.\n\nRegarding high training rounds:\nYou might see people say they have trained for hundreds of rounds, thousands of rounds (tens of thousands of rounds would be a mistake between rounds and steps). But high rounds are not necessarily good. If you want to train for a high number of rounds, please first ensure that the dataset is of very high quality, all tags have been manually proofread, and the duration is at least more than 1 hour before it is necessary to increase the number of rounds. Otherwise, the default of more than ten rounds is already very good.\nRound comparison can be seen in the video: [video link]\n\nRegarding dataset length:\nPlease ensure quality first! Audio must not have noise, it should be clear, loudness should be uniform, no reverb, each sentence should be complete, and all tags should be manually proofread. There is a significant improvement within 30 minutes, and it is not recommended to increase the length of the dataset (unless you have a bunch of 4090s).\nDetailed comparison can be seen in the video: [video link]\n\nHow do you know if the model is well trained?\nThis is a very boring and meaningless question. It's like asking a teacher how to learn well, and no one can answer it.\nModel training is related to the quality and duration of your dataset, the number of rounds, and even some supernatural factors; even if you have a finished model, the final conversion effect also depends on your reference audio and inference parameters. This is not a linear process, and there are too many variables in between, so if you have to ask \"why doesn't my model come out like it should,\" or \"how do you know if the model is well trained,\" I can only say WHO F**KING KNOWS?\n\nBut it's not that there's no way at all, you can just pray. I don't deny that praying is an effective method, but you can also use some scientific tools, such as Tensorboard, but still put on your headphones and let your ears tell you. Listening with your ears is the most scientific way.\nIf your model is always poor, then you should reflect on why you didn't prepare the dataset well.\n\nOutstanding model (V1) sharing (using 30 hours of Paimon dataset, 100% correct rate of annotation, enabling DPO)\n\nEmotion classification\nIf you have more than 1 hour of dataset, you can first classify emotions with Emotion2Vec or ColorSplitter before training. You will get more stable and richer emotions, but the tags must be manually proofread. See video for details: [video link]\n\nModel demonstration (V1) (classified five types with Paimon)\n\nRegarding Tensorboard\nGPT-SoVITS can enable Tensorboard, but what's the significance of the loss value when the number of rounds is less than 30? Listen with your ears.\n5: Inference\n5.1: Launching the Inference Interface\nFirst, refresh the model and select the model for inference from the dropdown menu. 'e' represents the number of epochs, and 's' represents the number of steps. A higher number of epochs does not always mean better. After selecting the model, click on \"Start TTS Inference,\" and the inference interface should pop up automatically. If it doesn't, copy and paste http://0.0.0.0:9872 into your browser to open it.\n\nPlease strictly differentiate between Epoch (rounds of training) and Step: 1 Epoch means all samples in the training set have participated in one round of learning, and 1 Step means one step of learning has taken place. ​\n \n\n5.2: Starting Inference\nAt the top, you can switch models, which is crucial when selecting a model immediately after training.\n\nThen, upload a reference audio clip, preferably one from the dataset. Ideally, it should be about 5 seconds long. The reference audio is very important as it helps in learning the speaking speed and tone, so please choose it carefully. The text for the reference audio should match what is being said in the audio clip, and the language should correspond. After version 0217, there is an option to use a model without reference text, but it is strongly discouraged as the results can be poor. It's just a matter of typing a few words in a few seconds; there's no need to be lazy. Note: It is a model without reference text, not without reference audio. Reference audio is always required!\n\nThere is an optional feature in the top right corner to blend voice colors. Place the audio files you want to blend into a folder and drag the entire folder into the interface (this feature is not very practical).\n\nNext, input the text you want to synthesize, making sure the language matches. Currently, it is possible to mix Chinese with English, Japanese with English, and Chinese, Japanese, and English together. It is recommended to divide the text into segments, aiming for about four sentences per segment. If there are fewer than four sentences, they will not be divided. If dividing by the number of segments causes an error, it may be due to insufficient video memory, in which case you can divide the text at periods. If you do not divide the text, the more video memory you have, the more you can synthesize; the 4090 can synthesize about 1000 characters, but the result may be incoherent, so even if you have a 4090, it is recommended to divide and synthesize in segments. Synthesizing text that is too long can easily result in incoherent speech.\n\nVersion 0213 introduced top_p, top_k, and temperature, which control randomness. It is recommended to keep the default settings as these values determine the randomness of the output. Increasing these values will increase randomness, so the default settings are recommended.\n\nIf you are using version 0206 (which has been discontinued), the same principles apply as mentioned above.\n\nVersion 0306fix3 introduced batch_size, segment interval, speed_factor, and repetition penalty. batch_size refers to the number of parallel inferences, which can be increased with more video memory for faster inference speed. Segment interval refers to the spacing of the divisions, not the spacing between each punctuation mark. speed_factor adjusts the speaking speed but is not recommended as it can affect audio quality. The repetition penalty is set by default.\n\nVersion 0213 introduced top_p, top_k, and temperature, which control randomness. It is recommended to keep the default settings as these values determine the randomness of the output. Increasing these values will increase randomness, so the default settings are recommended.\n\nIt is advised to divide the text into segments, aiming for about four sentences per segment. If there are fewer than four sentences, they will not be divided. If dividing by the number of segments causes an error, it may be due to insufficient video memory, in which case you can divide the text at periods. If you do not divide the text, the more video memory you have, the more you can synthesize; the 4090 can synthesize about 1000 characters, but the result may be incoherent, so even if you have a 4090, it is recommended to divide and synthesize in segments. Synthesizing text that is too long can easily result in incoherent speech.\n\nParallel inference and data bucketing are recommended for speed improvements, and maintaining randomness can add emotional richness to the output.\n\nRegarding top_p, top_k, and temperature:\nThese three values control sampling. During inference, the best token needs to be selected, but the machine does not know which one is the best. So, top_k is used to select the top tokens, and top_p filters tokens based on top_k. Finally, temperature controls the randomness of the output.\n\nFor example, if there are 100 tokens in total, with top_k set to 5 and top_p set to 0.6, and temperature set to 0.5, the system will first select the 5 tokens with the highest probability (0.3, 0.3, 0.2, 0.2, 0.1). It will then select tokens with a cumulative probability not exceeding 0.6 (0.3 and 0.3), and randomly output one of these tokens, with the first token having a higher chance of being selected. This process continues.\n\nIf you still don't understand, set it to maximum for a more random output, or set it to minimum for a more repetitive output.\n\nRegarding repetition penalty:\nA setting of 1 means no penalty for repetition, > 1 starts penalizing repetition, and < 1 encourages repetition. It is generally set to > 1 because repetition is quite common.\n\nIf there are issues with missing words, repetition, or the mixing of reference audio, this is normal. To improve this, use a GPT model with a lower number of epochs, shorten the synthesis text, or change the reference audio. The official team is also working hard to fix these issues.\n\nIf there is constant repetition, it is likely due to inaccurate labeling. Manually proofread and retrain the model.\n\nRefAudioEmoTagger Tool\nProject address: RefAudioEmoTagger on GitHub (if you can, give the project a star)\nAuthor: Alexw1111\nDownload the integrated package here: 123 Cloud Disk\nAfter unzipping, double-click go-web.bat to open.\n\nThe input folder should be the directory of the training set audio files from the previous step of outputting logs. Choose the list method for renaming audio, and the path of the .list file should be the path from the logs output step. Select the emotion2vec+ model for better results, then click on one-click inference.\n\nAfter completion, the output directory will be in the root directory's output folder.\n\nAudio will be categorized into up to five emotional classes, but it may also only have two or even just one class, depending on the richness of the data.\n\nAt the same time, each audio file will be relabeled and renamed, ready for use.\n6: Sharing Models\nThe required models for sharing are located in the SoVITS_weights_v2 and GPT_weights_v2 folders. Select the model with the appropriate number of epochs and remember to include the reference audio in a compressed file for sharing. Others can simply place the GPT model (with the ckpt extension) into the GPT_weights_v2 folder and the SoVITS model (with the pth extension) into the SoVITS_weights_v2 folder to start inference.\n\n7: Using Shared Models\nTo use a model shared by someone else, place the GPT model (with the ckpt extension) into the GPT_weights_v2 folder and the SoVITS model (with the pth extension) into the SoVITS_weights_v2 folder. Refresh the model list to select the model for inference.\n\n8: Training a Second Model\nRemember to remove the audio from the previous slicing folder and the annotation files from the asr folder to avoid adding them to the training set. Be sure to change the model name when training! The steps remain the same. The models will still be located in the GPT_weights_v2 and SoVITS_weights_v2 folders.\n\nRegarding voice modification features:\nThe feature is not yet completed, and everyone will see a \"Construction in Progress, Please Wait for Good News\" message for now. It's not a missing file issue, but rather the feature is still under development. Stay tuned.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions:\n\nWhere can I download the integrated package? At the beginning of the document.\nCan A-card / Apple users run it? A-card is not supported, but you can train 30-second audio with the CPU, which is quite fast and the effect is not too bad. MAC users can check it out.\nWhy does the training start but then seem to freeze? As long as there are no errors, it's running. If your dataset is not very large (less than 5 hours), the terminal should display the first training log within 10 minutes. If there is no new output log after more than 10 minutes, try increasing the virtual memory or reducing the batch size and then restart the training.\nWhat if I want to add more to the dataset during training? You will need to preprocess again and start training from the beginning.\nIs it normal for inference to take a long time, with minutes of audio taking tens of minutes to process? If the console has no response, it may be that Gradio is malfunctioning and not running at all, so you're waiting in vain. It is recommended to restart and reduce the amount of text. If the console is active, it is running, and some GPUs may take several minutes to process, so be patient.\nFor other issues: there are solutions to some errors, and you can also visit GitHub to see if anyone has asked questions or post your own question. Copying the error message to ask ChatGPT is also a good method.\n\nIf your question is not among the common ones listed above, you can consult the discussion group. However, there is an art to asking questions. A good question can stimulate others' interest in responding, which speeds up the problem-solving process, saving your time and reducing everyone's stress, which is a win-win situation.\n\nCrying out for help with phrases like \"Help, someone!\" will not get you faster assistance but may increase stress levels. Avoid irrelevant language.\n\nDescribe in detail the problem you are encountering and what you did before encountering the problem. Many times, the issue you encounter may simply be due to forgetting a step, and sometimes you can discover the issue by going through your steps.\n\nJust posting a red \"Error\" won't help; even God could only guess. What I need is a detailed error log, which can be viewed in the terminal.\n\nRead the documentation, read the documentation, read the documentation. 90% of the questions asked in the group every day can be solved by consulting the documentation. Everyone's time is valuable, so solve it yourself if you can, without bothering others.\n\nAn example of a good question:\nHello everyone, I encountered a problem when fine-tuning the SoVITS model for training. The terminal error is \"division by zero\". Here is the terminal error screenshot: [Complete error screenshot], and here is the web screenshot: [Complete web screenshot]. I have checked the common errors and error collections in the documentation but did not find a similar issue. Does anyone know how to solve it? I would be very grateful!\n\nAn example of a bad question:\nI got an error when training the SoVITS model, what should I do?"
